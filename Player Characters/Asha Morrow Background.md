## Overview

Asha Morrow is a Confederacy marine veteran turned independent mercenary captain, trying to carve out a life that isn't owned by anyone. 
She is decisive, fast on the draw, and socially agile, using charm and presence to keep her crew together and clients off her back. On paper she's just another gun-for-hire; in practice she is a battlefield-tested officer with deep family ties to the Confederacy's war machine.

---

## Early Life & Family

Asha was born into a line of Confederacy naval officers and engineers who served on the **Sorrow of Wyrms**, a battleship that earned its name in the war against Nebiat.  
Her childhood memories are a blend of bulkheads and brief shore leaves, growing up in shipboard creches where children learned to walk in microgravity and recite fleet protocols before bedtime stories.  
Her mother was a decorated major and shipboard commander, fiercely Pro-Ternus despite wearing the Confederacy crest; her father served as the ship's chief engineer, married more to the reactor core than the regulations.

- **Mom - Major Morrow**: Tactical genius with a kill record that made for endless propaganda reels, outwardly composed but privately ruthless about what the Confederacy needed to win. She drilled into Asha the doctrine that hesitation kills crews.
- **Dad - Chief Engineer Morrow**: Quiet, methodical, and endlessly patient, he taught Asha how to listen to the hum of engines, how to tell from a vibration in the hull when something was wrong, and how to fix things three minutes before they failed.
- **Family Expectations**: Asha was groomed from early on for an officer's track both because of privilege, and also because the ship's command staff fully expected her to be another Morrow on the roster.

Born a generation after the war ended, Asha grew up hearing stories of the fall of **Colony 3** and the siege of **New Texas** as cautionary tales whispered by veterans; the scars of that conflict shaped the world she inherited, even if she never saw the casualty lists scroll in real time.

## Military Service

Asha "volunteered" for marine service the moment she was old enough, long before anyone had to threaten conscription. She framed it as patriotism and family duty; privately, it was the only path that made sense in a life shaped by hull plating and battle plans.

### Training & Early Tours

- Assigned to shipboard marine detachments attached to capital ships and escorts, specializing in **zero-G boarding, corridor fighting, and security sweeps**.  
- Excelled in **small-unit command**, high-stress decision-making, and piloting dropships and shuttles in hot extractions. 
- Learned to love the feeling of a ship's controls under her hands far more than the parade-ground shine of marines on review.

### Combat Experience

Asha has "seen combat" in the understated way veterans use to avoid telling you how bad it was.

- Fought in actions where **dragons of Virkon** were not the figurative enemy but actual threats, scaled titans slipping between ships in the vacuum, shredding hulls with their breath and claws.
- Clashed with **war mages** and elite Virkonan operatives whose spells and tech tore through bulkheads like paper; Asha's unit learned to treat mages like artillery: survive the first volley, close the distance, and remove the problem.
- Participated in at least one operation defending a convoy bound for the front near the **Colony 3 disaster zone**.

Her battalion spent a full rotation on front-line duty before being cycled back for "refit and reassignment", bureaucratic code for becoming **second-rate cannon fodder** while the tech-mage corps and experimental units took priority.

---

## Leaving the Marines

When orders came down that her battalion would be broken up to support experimental tech-mage operations, Asha read between the lines: they were going to be used as ablative armor for more valuable assets. 
With her mother still serving and her father still tied to the Sorrow of Wyrms, Asha faced a choice between loyalty to blood and survival of self.

- She burned favors, pulled strings, and **took her discharge the first minute regulations allowed**, officially on grounds of "contract completion and fleet restructuring."  
- Unofficially, she refused to lead squads into meat-grinder scenarios designed to test the limits of war mages, Catalyst weapons, or experimental relic tech.
- Leaving meant **breaking with her family's expectations**; her mother had few words on it, her father called it adaptation, and Asha quietly filed both reactions away.

By the time her old battalion shipped back out, Asha was already working her first civilian jobs as a shuttle pilot, running cargo and personnel to stations that pretended they were too unimportant for the war to notice.

---

## Current Life as a Mercenary Captain

Years later, Asha has carved out a space as a **captain-for-hire**, running a corvette that takes small to mid-tier contracts: freight, escort, extraction, discreet transport, and troubleshooting in dangerous or unstable zones.  
Her military record gives her credibility with some clients and makes others nervous; nobody likes hiring someone who might still have friends in Internal Security.

- **Leadership Style**: Calm under fire, opportunistic, and quietly ruthless about keeping her ship and people alive; she prefers clever cons, forged manifests, and walking away from bad odds over glorious last stands. She listens hard to experts like mages and veteran crews, then makes a call and commits without flinching.  
- **Crew Dynamics**: Keeps her crew small and need-to-know but not in the dark, looping them into big-picture risks and giving everyone a voice before she sets the course.
- **Reputation**: On hubs she's known as a smart‑reckless captain, but not willing to burn crew or clients for a payout. Shadow brokers and merc outfits alike see her as profitable, discreet, and stubborn enough to walk out of lowball offers or black‑ops death traps, even when the money's obscene.

Her **Ranged, Piloting, and Athletics** training keeps her on the pointy end when necessary, but as captain she increasingly fights with **Negotiation, presence, and timing** instead of just bullets.

---

## Level of Comfort & Finances

Asha lives **comfortably by frontier standards** but nowhere near officer-club luxury.

- **Income**: Contract-based and irregular. Some months she pulls in enough credits to overhaul parts of the ship; other months she eats ration bricks and prays nothing critical fails.  
- **Debts**: Maintains a careful balance of ship payments, docking fees, and favors owed. She hates owing more than one major entity at a time and works hard to keep the ledger clean.
- **Spending Priorities**: Ship maintenance, ammunition, crew shares, and the occasional splurge on good whiskey or a proper meal planetside. She thinks constantly in terms of **runway**: how many weeks of bad contracts can she ride out?

She is not rich, but she is **free enough** to say no to some jobs, and that alone makes her wealthier than many veterans.

## Home: A Low-Key Place to Unwind

Though she spends most of her time aboard ship, Asha keeps a **small, low-profile apartment** on Ternus, a place to crash between jobs and pretend for a few nights that she has a normal life.

Reference [[Player Houses]] and [[Session 1 Log]] for table details; mechanically, the place includes:

- Small battery  
- Nice bed  
- Air filter  
- Basic door  
- Stove  
- Holoscreen  
- Net uplink  
- Sensor strip  
- **Cost**: 1680 cr, 1 attachment; consumes 1/2 battery every 4 days  
- Vibe: a **low-key place to unwind for a captain who usually lives in her ship** while out on jobs.

### Atmosphere

The apartment is tidy but impersonal: a few photos tacked up with magnetic clips, a stack of worn field manuals, a duffel that's never fully unpacked.  
When she's there, Asha runs the holo-screen on low volume with old war dramas or trashy reality shows, something loud enough to drown out her own thoughts.  
The sensor strip and basic security are less about paranoia and more about being able to **sleep without boots on** for once.

---

## Contacts & Allies

Asha isn't a social butterfly, but years in the service and on the circuit have left her with a network of people who answer her calls.

1. **Old Squadmates** - A scattering of marines she served with, now rotated into station security, private outfits, or training cadres. They share information, the occasional bunk, and unspoken understandings about what not to ask.
2. **Dockmaster "Harv"** - A gruff, overworked dockmaster on New Texas (or local equivalent) who handles her berths. Harv grumbles about paperwork but quietly nudges her toward safer contracts and away from clients who don't pay.
3. **Quartermistress Elira Konn** - A black-market arms and armor dealer with a legitimate front. Asha buys specialty ammo and armor upgrades from her; in return, Elira occasionally asks her to move crates the customs scanners "missed."
4. **Lieutenant Rax Dal** - An Internal Security liaison she once pulled out of a bad situation during the war. They aren't friends, but they respect each other, and sometimes he feeds her warnings when certain routes get "hot."
5. **Civilian Pilots' Union Rep** - Nominal contact with a loose association of independent pilots. Useful for scuttlebutt about rates, bad clients, and sectors where ships go missing.

Most of these people would help her, but none of them are fully safe to rely on; every favor owed has strings.

## Factions With Their Eyes on Her

Asha occupies an awkward space between civilian and asset, which makes her interesting to several groups.

### Confederacy Defense Forces / Marines

- **Why**: Her record and family history make her a proven commodity-someone they could attempt to re-recruit if the war escalates.  
- **Status**: Officially discharged with honors; unofficially, her name appears in lists whenever someone in logistics asks, "Who can we lean on for deniable work?"  
- **Risk**: Moderate. A single "patriotic" envoy with the right leverage (or threat) could yank her back into the machine.

### Smugglers & Shadow Brokers

- **Why**: She's disciplined, ex-military, and usually not curious about cargo details so long as the pay is right and nobody lies to her about the danger level.  
- **Status**: Known as a captain who won't carry obvious war crimes and won't traffic in people. For some brokers, that makes her principled; for others, it makes her inconvenient.

### Questions for Asha

1. What specific battle or operation does Asha **refuse to talk about**, and why?  
2. Does she still speak to her parents, and if so, what was their last conversation like?  
3. What line **won't** she cross for a contract-even if her crew is desperate for the money?  
4. What does Asha do for genuine **comfort or joy** when nobody is watching (hobby, ritual, guilty pleasure)?  
5. If the Confederacy tried to pull her back in with a "one last mission" pitch, what could tempt her to say yes-and what would make her slam the airlock in their faces?
