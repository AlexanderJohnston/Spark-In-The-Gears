## Military Service

Confederacy marine conscripted voluntarily.
Military service runs in the family.

Figure Asha's background experience in the military. She has seen combat.
Seen combat against dragons in space as well as war mages.

Her battalion returned from the front lines and she decided to leave instead of being second-rate cannon fodder in front of the tech mages.

Decent ex-military contacts, probably some she has worked with as a civilian pilot. 


# Parents

## Mom

Mom was a major leading a battleship called the "Sorrow of Wyrms" in the conflict between Ternus and Nebiat / Nefarious and her Guardian Talifax. That was back when Colony 3 was wiped out (that was the bread basket) and New Texas was under siege. Back when Shaya was also under siege.

Her mom was strongly Pro-Ternus and despised the Shayan Confederacy despite working for it. She had incredible record with lots of kills -- expand that later.

## Dad

Chief Engineer of Sorrow of Wyrms. They're still together probably on New Texas surface.
