## Level of Comfort & Financial Situation

**Modest but Stable** — After two decades on Ternus, Kaelith has established himself as a capable Relic Hunter and arcane consultant. He's not wealthy, but he's far from destitute.

- **Income**: Irregular but adequate. He takes commissions from various factions to identify, stabilize, or restore relics. Some months bring lucrative contracts; others are lean.
- **Debts**: Minimal. Kaelith learned early that owing too much to the wrong people on Ternus means becoming a tool. He pays in advance when possible and keeps contracts simple.
- **Luxuries**: Few. He doesn't indulge in fine food or expensive clothes. His spending goes toward books, archive access, rare components, and occasionally bribing officials for permits.
- **Status**: Respected in certain circles (artificers, smugglers, fringe scholars), unknown to most. He prefers it that way.

## Domicile: The Ember Workshop

Kaelith's home is a **converted foundry substation** in the Rustward District — a transitional zone between the industrial sprawl and the residential megablocks. It's neither wealthy nor impoverished, which suits him.

### Physical Description
- **Location**: Third sublevel of a decommissioned grid relay tower. The upper floors house small workshops and tech-repair stalls; Kaelith's space is below, accessible via a rusted spiral staircase.
- **Size**: A single large chamber (roughly 40' x 30'), with high ceilings marked by old ventilation ducts and heat-scarred girders.
- **Workshop Area**: The main space is dominated by worktables cluttered with relics in various states of disassembly, tools (both mundane and arcane), crystals, molten glass shards, and burned scrolls. Chalk diagrams cover sections of the floor — remnants of stabilization rituals.
- **Living Area**: A small alcove partitioned by a heavy curtain. Contains a narrow cot, a shelf of books (mix of Shayan philosophical texts and Ternan engineering manuals), and a small shrine holding the **Heartroot Shard** talisman from his mother.
- **Lighting**: Dim and atmospheric. Kaelith uses low-heat alchemical lanterns and occasionally his own Void-touched flames, which burn black-cored and smokeless.
- **Temperature**: Perpetually warm. The foundry's old heat exchangers still leak residual warmth through the walls, and Kaelith's fire magic reinforces the effect. It's one of the few places on Ternus that reminds him of Shaya's living warmth — albeit twisted through iron and soot.
- **Security**: Basic warding glyphs etched into the doorframe (combination of Shayan and improvised Ternan magitech). A single locked door, reinforced. The tower's other tenants know him and generally leave him alone.

### Atmosphere
The Ember Workshop feels like a place where endings and beginnings coexist. It smells of metal dust, ozone, and faint incense. Visitors describe it as unnervingly quiet — the air grows still when Kaelith works, as though even sound hesitates around his Void aura.

## Recent Faction Interactions

Kaelith's reputation has drawn attention from multiple factions in recent months. Here's what he's been involved with:

### **Soulsmith Collective** (Most Frequent Contact)
- **Recent Work**: Two weeks ago, Kaelith was contracted to stabilize a malfunctioning clinic-core in the lower blocks. The core was singing — a sign of Echo influence or Catalyst degradation. He managed to dampen the resonance without destroying the core, keeping the clinic operational.
- **Contact**: Dr. Lysa Oro, a Soulsmith physician who operates a small street clinic. She's contacted him multiple times for "quiet consultations" about cores and relics exhibiting strange behavior. Kaelith suspects she knows more about Catalyst extraction ethics than she admits.
- **Reputation**: Trusted. The Soulsmiths appreciate his discretion and his ability to work with unstable magic without panicking.

### **Catalyst Authority** (Wary Distance)
- **Recent Interaction**: An Authority auditor visited the Ember Workshop ten days ago, ostensibly to verify Kaelith's permits for handling relic material. The visit was polite but invasive — the auditor scanned several relics with a wand and asked pointed questions about Kaelith's "unique resonance signature."
- **Concern**: Kaelith's Void magic makes him read strangely on their instruments. He suspects they're trying to determine if he's a security risk or a potential asset.
- **Status**: Monitored, but not yet flagged for arrest or recruitment.

### **Shipwright Guilds** (Occasional Contracts)
- **Recent Work**: Last month, Kaelith was hired by a junior engineer to diagnose why a derelict ship core wouldn't bond with a new hull. He discovered the core was haunted by an Echo fragment — not malicious, just confused. He performed a quiet rite to help the fragment disperse.
- **Reputation**: Known as expensive but effective. Shipwrights call him when standard engineers fail and the project is too valuable to scrap.

### **Void Syndicates** (Mutual Avoidance)
- **Recent Encounter**: Three weeks ago, a Void navigator approached him in a market, offering payment for instruction in Void manipulation. Kaelith politely declined. He doesn't trust their methods — they treat the Void like a tool, not a force that requires balance.
- **Status**: They respect his skill but consider him too cautious and "Shayan" in his approach.

### **Independent Smugglers & Salvagers** (Regular Clients)
- **Recent Work**: Ongoing. Kaelith helps stabilize black-market relics before they're sold. He doesn't ask where they came from, and smugglers don't ask why his flames burn black.
- **Reputation**: Reliable. Pays fairly and doesn't snitch to authorities.

## Loose Contacts on Ternus

Kaelith has been on Ternus long enough to develop a small network of people he can call on (or who might call on him):

1. **Dr. Lysa Oro** (Soulsmith) — His most frequent contact. She runs a clinic in the lower blocks and occasionally feeds him information about strange relic activity.

2. **Toben Gresk** (Salvager) — A grizzled scrap-hauler who occasionally brings Kaelith "weird finds" from the Ash Wastes. Toben doesn't understand magic, but he knows when something feels wrong. He pays Kaelith in information, components, or credits.

3. **Magistra Sellen Vey** (Archivist) — Works in the Ternan Archive of Pre-Collapse Technology. She grants Kaelith access to restricted texts in exchange for his insights on Shayan mysticism. Their relationship is purely professional, but she's one of the few people on Ternus who treats him like a scholar rather than a curiosity.

4. **"Kip"** (Child Navigator) — A twelve-year-old flame-reader who works the tram platforms. Kaelith once gave her a stabilizing charm when she was overwhelmed by Void resonance. She remembers. Occasionally, she tips him off when InSec auditors are sweeping the district.

5. **Rhen Torvald** (Fence) — A low-level smuggler who moves black-market relics. Kaelith helps him authenticate goods. Rhen owes him favors but also knows Kaelith's secrets (including his Void magic), which makes their relationship tense.

6. **Unnamed Krox Trade Emissary** — Kaelith was approached once, months ago, by a Krox representative who seemed interested in his knowledge of Shayan relics and Void magic. The conversation was cordial but unnerving. Kaelith suspects the Krox are cataloging assets for future use.

## Factions That Have Their Sights on Him

Kaelith's unique skills and nature make him a person of interest to several groups:

### **InSec (Internal Security)**
- **Why**: Kaelith's Void magic signature is anomalous. He reads on their scanners like someone heavily exposed to Catalyst saturation, but he has no official record of extraction work. InSec is debating whether he's a smuggler, a foreign agent, or something worse.
- **Current Status**: Under passive surveillance. They haven't moved against him yet, but auditors have "randomly" encountered him three times in the past month.
- **Risk Level**: Moderate. If InSec decides he's a threat, they could detain him for "questioning" or attempt to conscript him.

### **Catalyst Authority Procurement Division**
- **Why**: They're interested in his ability to stabilize degraded relics and Echo-touched artifacts. They suspect he has access to techniques not found in Ternan engineering manuals.
- **Current Status**: Watching. They've sent auditors and middlemen to probe his capabilities.
- **Risk Level**: Low to Moderate. They'd prefer to recruit him rather than antagonize him, but they're not above pressure tactics.

### **The Krox Trade Mission**
- **Why**: The Krox are fascinated by Void magic and non-human magical traditions. A Shayan Void mage is a rare prize — both as a potential ally and a research subject.
- **Current Status**: Observing from a distance. They've made one polite contact and are waiting to see if Kaelith becomes desperate enough to accept patronage.
- **Risk Level**: Unknown. Krox play long games. Kaelith doesn't trust them.

### **Soulsmith Underground Network**
- **Why**: They see Kaelith as a potential ally in their quiet resistance against Catalyst exploitation. Dr. Oro has been subtly feeling him out for deeper involvement.
- **Current Status**: Friendly but cautious. They respect his boundaries but hope he'll commit when the stakes rise.
- **Risk Level**: None currently, but association with them could draw InSec attention.

### **Echo Entities (Non-Faction Threat)**
- **Why**: Kaelith's work with relics and cores brings him into contact with Echo fragments — remnants of dead gods embedded in Catalysts. Some Echos recognize his Void magic and attempt to communicate or bargain. A few have grown obsessed with him, whispering through relics he examines.
- **Current Status**: Passive but persistent. One Echo in particular, bound to a reactor core he stabilized last year, occasionally "calls" to him through resonance when he sleeps.
- **Risk Level**: Moderate to High. Echos are unpredictable and can corrupt or possess if Kaelith lets his guard down.

## Potential Role in the War

The war between the Confederacy and the Virkonna storm-kin has been escalating, and Ternus is a critical supply hub. Kaelith has stayed neutral so far, but that's becoming harder.

### **How He Could Be Dragged In:**

1. **Conscription/Recruitment**: InSec or the Confederacy could attempt to draft him as a "specialist" for high-risk relic recovery or Void navigation support. His Void magic makes him valuable for operations in unstable space.

2. **Forced Expertise**: If a critical shipyard or clinic suffers a Catalyst core failure during a military operation, authorities might compel Kaelith to stabilize it — framing refusal as treason or negligence.

3. **Krox Alliance Offer**: The Krox could offer him protection, resources, and knowledge in exchange for service. This would make him a traitor in Confederacy eyes but might offer answers about Void magic he can't find elsewhere.

4. **Soulsmith Involvement**: If the Soulsmiths escalate their resistance to Catalyst extraction, Kaelith might be drawn in to protect clinics or help refugees. This would put him in direct conflict with InSec and the Catalyst Authority.

5. **Echo Manipulation**: An Echo entity might attempt to use Kaelith as a vessel or agent, promising power or knowledge in exchange for freedom. This could spiral into possession or a bargain he can't escape.

6. **Relic Heist Complication**: If Kaelith gets involved in the spark shipment heist (the campaign's inciting incident), his unique skills could make him indispensable — or a target. Factions involved in the heist might try to claim him as an asset.

### **Kaelith's Current Stance:**
He wants no part of the war. He's seen what happens when gods fight, and he refuses to become a tool in another cosmic conflict. But neutrality is a luxury he may not be able to afford much longer.

## Additional Session Zero Considerations

### **Themes for the Player to Explore:**
- **Identity**: Kaelith is caught between two worlds — Shayan exile and Ternan resident. Does he still consider himself Shayan? Does he want to return home someday? Or has Ternus become home?
- **Power and Corruption**: Kaelith's magic is inherently entropic. How does he justify using Void magic in a world that fears it? Does he believe the Tree was wrong to condemn him, or does he fear they were right?
- **Isolation vs. Connection**: Kaelith has spent years keeping people at arm's length. The campaign might force him to rely on others. How does he handle that vulnerability?
- **Ethics of Catalyst Use**: As Kaelith learns the truth about "sparks" and Catalyst extraction, he'll have to decide where he stands. Is the industrial consumption of divine essence acceptable? Or is it an atrocity?

### **Potential Character Goals:**
- Discover the truth about the Tree of Shaya's current state. Has it changed? Could he ever return?
- Find balance between Void and Fire — perhaps by studying other Aspect traditions or seeking a mentor.
- Protect the people of Ternus from exploitation by factions that see them as resources.
- Avoid becoming a tool of any faction — maintain autonomy at all costs.
- Confront the Echo that haunts him and decide whether to help it, bind it, or destroy it.

### **Relationships to Define with the Group:**
- How did Kaelith meet the other PCs? Did he help them with relic work? Were they hired together for a previous job?
- Does anyone in the group know about his Shayan heritage? Or does he keep that secret?
- Has he worked with any of them before, or is this the first time they've collaborated?

### **Questions for the Player to Answer:**
1. What does Kaelith do for comfort or joy in the Ember Workshop? Does he have a hobby, a ritual, or a guilty pleasure?
2. What's the one relic or artifact he's kept for himself rather than selling? Why is it important?
3. How does he feel about the block where he lives? Does he care about the people there, or is it just a convenient location?
4. What would it take for him to abandon neutrality and pick a side in the conflict?
5. If he could send one message back to Shaya Prime (knowing it might never arrive), what would he say?

## Summary

Kaelith Voryn-Shai stands at a crossroads. His skills have made him valuable, his magic has made him suspect, and his neutrality is crumbling. The weeks leading up to the campaign have been tense — auditors at his door, Echos in his dreams, and the constant hum of a city that devours divine corpses for fuel.

When the power cuts hit and the ration lines fail, Kaelith will have to choose: stay in the shadows and hope the storm passes, or step forward and risk becoming what he's always feared — a tool of forces beyond his control.

The kettle is about to stop singing. And Kaelith Voryn-Shai will have to decide what that silence means.
