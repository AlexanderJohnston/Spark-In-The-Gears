# Character Ideas for Bunny — Sparks in the Gears Campaign

## Campaign Context
This guide presents character concepts for the *Sparks in the Gears* campaign, set on Ternus—a gritty, industrial hive-world where magic (sparks) is rationed like fuel, and survival means navigating faction politics, heists, and hard moral choices. The party already includes **Kaelith Voryn-Shai**, an exiled Shayan Relic Hunter who wields Void/Fire magic and has deep knowledge of ancient artifacts and magitech systems.

## Character Archetype Ideas

### 1. **The Soulsmith Medic/Mechanic**
*"Life-saving through forbidden tech, one miracle at a time."*

#### **Core Concept**
A former clinic technician who specializes in necrotech and living machines—patching both people and the spark-powered devices that keep them alive. You blur the line between healer and engineer, using Soulsmith techniques that some consider salvation and others call horror.

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Life or Spirit
- **Life:** Traditional healing with a technical twist—life-support systems, bio-augmentation, stabilizing spark sickness
- **Spirit:** Necrotech specialist who treats consciousness as software that can be debugged, backed up, or transplanted

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Complementary:** Kaelith unmakes and destroys corrupted relics; you rebuild and repurpose them into life-saving tools
- **Philosophical Tension:** He sees entropy as natural; you fight it tooth and nail every shift
- **Practical Team Dynamic:** He's the archaeologist who finds the relic; you're the engineer who makes it useful
- **Emotional Balance:** His brooding acceptance of endings pairs with your stubborn refusal to let things die

#### **Pros**
- Essential support role—you keep people alive in a scarcity economy
- Access to faction contacts (Church clinics, Soulsmith collectives, black market aug-dealers)
- Morally complex choices: save many with rationed miracles vs. save the few with forbidden tech
- Strong ties to the block—you've treated their kids, their elders, their spark-sick
- Can interface with ship systems as easily as bodies

#### **Cons**
- High emotional cost—triage choices haunt you
- Target for Catalyst Authority audits (necrotech is regulated/banned)
- Resource scarcity—always need more charge-caps, more parts, more time
- Moral dilemmas built into every session (who lives when you can't save everyone?)

#### **Example Backstory: Tessa "Sparrow" Venn**
Tessa grew up in Block 19's Church clinic, where her mother worked as an orderly. When a spark ration cut killed three newborns in one night, fifteen-year-old Tessa started scavenging derelict med-bays for parts. She taught herself to hotline charge-caps, overclock diagnostic wands, and coax one more hour from dying life-support cores.

By twenty, she'd become the block's underground miracle worker—the one you called when the clinic said "nothing more can be done." She saved a docker's daughter with a refurbished necrotech spine that let her walk again. She kept Old Man Chen's heart beating with a reactor shard she wasn't licensed to touch. The Church Sisters looked the other way; the Auditors did not.

Now she runs a gray-market workshop in the maintenance sublevel, one floor above the water processors. She treats dockworkers, smugglers, and anyone who can't afford official care. At night, she hears the children she couldn't save—their flatlines echo in the hum of the machinery. She tells herself every life she steals back from the dark justifies the rules she breaks. Some nights, she believes it.

Tessa joined the crew because they promised her one thing the clinic never had: enough spark to say "yes" instead of "choose."

### 2. **The Void Navigator/Flame-Reader**
*"I read the shadows, and they tell me where the real doors are."*

#### **Core Concept**
A mystic navigator who charts safe routes through the Void and reads omen-fire like weather. You see patterns others miss—shadow eddies in tram tunnels, temporal distortions in cargo bay corners, and the spaces between moments where reality is negotiable.

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Void or Dream
- **Void:** Traditional shadow-charting, sensing entropy flows, navigating impossible spaces
- **Dream:** Precognitive visions, reading probable futures in engine-fire, detecting lies and illusions

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Shared Language:** Both understand Void at a fundamental level; you navigate it, he unmakes with it
- **Tactical Partnership:** Your navigation + his entropy manipulation = getting in and out of "impossible" places
- **Philosophical Alignment:** Both see death/endings as natural transitions rather than failures
- **Complementary Skills:** You find the way; he clears the obstacles; together you're unstoppable infiltrators

#### **Pros**
- High-value skill set—every crew needs a navigator who can read shadow-lanes
- Mystical knowledge makes you indispensable (faction syndicates pay well for charts)
- Natural scout/infiltrator role—you sense danger before it arrives
- Poetic, atmospheric character moments (reading omens, prophetic dreams, "the fire says...")
- Avoid fights by taking paths enemies can't follow

#### **Cons**
- Potentially isolating—spending too long in the Void changes you
- Cryptic communication style can frustrate direct-action players
- Requires GM to provide meaningful omen/prophecy content
- Risk of "madness" mechanics or spark-sickness from Void exposure
- Less mechanically useful in straightforward combat encounters

#### **Example Backstory: Iyara "Echo" Moth**
Iyara was born during a Void incursion—a spatial eddy that trapped her mother's transport between realities for six hours. When they emerged, the baby was breathing but her eyes reflected nothing. The doctors called her blind. Iyara called it "seeing differently."

She grew up sensing shapes in shadows, hearing whispers in static, feeling the texture of time like worn cloth. The Void Nav Syndicates found her at fourteen, recognizing what her parents could not—she was a natural flame-reader, one who could chart shadow-lanes without instruments.

For a decade she worked syndicate contracts, mapping "ghost routes" through the underhive where auditors' wands went haywire and InSec patrols never quite arrived. She earned the name "Echo" because she could predict events minutes before they happened, her warnings arriving like echoes traveling backward through time.

Then she charted a route that shouldn't exist—a stable corridor into the old reactor district, sealed since the Godswar. Inside, she found machinery that sang in harmony with the Void, whispering promises of power to anyone willing to listen. She fled, but the whispers followed.

Now she charts for the crew, seeking answers about the machinery she found and the voices that still call her name in the spaces between shifts. The Syndicates want her maps; the Catalyst Authority wants her silenced; and the whispers want her to come back.

### 3. **The Union Enforcer/Shipbreaker**
*"Management forgot that ships are built by people. Let me remind them."*

#### **Core Concept**
A tough, pragmatic dockworker who protects the union, breaks scab strikes, and turns starship hulls into weapons when negotiations fail. You're the muscle with a conscience—fighting for fair wages, safe shifts, and the folks who keep Ternus running while the Confederacy ships profits off-world.

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Earth/Nature or Fire
- **Earth:** Immovable defender, union rock, the one who stands firm when everyone else runs
- **Fire:** Passionate revolutionary, forge-worker turned fighter, burning bright against injustice

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Complementary Combat Roles:** He's precision destruction (single-target Void/Fire); you're crowd control/tank
- **Narrative Balance:** He's introspective and philosophical; you're direct action and practical solutions
- **Moral Grounding:** His detachment from mortal concerns needs your passionate investment in people
- **Tactical Dynamic:** He destroys what can't be saved; you protect what must survive

#### **Pros**
- Clear motivations rooted in community (easy to roleplay)
- Powerful faction ties (Shipwrights Guild connections, union solidarity)
- Physical powerhouse role—front-line tank/DPS
- Strong moral compass provides party direction in ethically murky situations
- Respected in the block—people trust you to do the right thing

#### **Cons**
- Less flexible in social situations requiring subtlety or deception
- Union loyalties can conflict with crew's illegal activities
- "Muscle" role can feel one-dimensional if not developed narratively
- May struggle in scenarios requiring technical or arcane solutions
- Guild politics could force hard choices between crew and union

#### **Example Backstory: Kael "Ironside" Durant**
Kael's father died when a faulty scaffold collapsed in Drydock Seven. The inquiry blamed "worker negligence." The union knew better—management had cut safety inspections to meet the Confederacy's battleship quota. Kael was sixteen, watching them lower her father's empty casket (they never recovered the body).

She joined the union the next day.

By thirty, she'd become the enforcer the dockworkers whispered about—six feet of grim determination and calloused knuckles. She stood between scabs and picket lines. She negotiated with management by turning their own equipment into creative obstacles. When words failed, she spoke in bent metal and shattered kneecaps.

Kael discovered her magic during a strike-turned-riot. A guard fired into the crowd; she threw her body in front of a teenager and felt the air solidify like stone. The bullets stopped. She didn't. Something in her blood remembered the old Earthmother's strength, and Ternus's iron bones answered.

Now she's the shield the crew didn't know they needed. She takes the hits, holds the line, and makes sure everyone goes home. But she still hears the scaffold collapse in her nightmares—metal screaming like a living thing—and wakes knowing that some debts can only be paid in justice or blood.

### 4. **The Catalyst Auditor with a Conscience**
*"I carry a wand that can starve your block. I've started using it to feed mine."*

#### **Core Concept**
A former Catalyst Authority enforcer who measured spark rations, flagged "irregular" individuals, and denied charges with a signature. You had power, authority, and the trust of a system that used you to maintain scarcity. Then you learned what they do with the spark they claim is "rationed for safety."

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Light or Spirit
- **Light:** Illuminating truth, exposing corruption, literally seeing through lies and bureaucratic shadows
- **Spirit:** Reading souls/intentions with your wand, detecting spark-sickness, understanding the consciousness within catalysts

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Investigative Partnership:** He understands ancient magic; you understand modern exploitation of it
- **Access Combination:** His relic knowledge + your bureaucratic clearances = infiltrating anywhere
- **Moral Contrast:** He's accepted exile and loss; you're actively betraying everything you were trained to uphold
- **Complementary Magic:** His Void/Fire destruction + your Light/Spirit revelation = exposing and eliminating corruption

#### **Pros**
- Unique insider knowledge of Catalyst Authority protocols and vulnerabilities
- Legitimate credentials useful for infiltration and social manipulation
- Built-in character arc (redemption, conscience vs. duty, atonement)
- Can provide critical intel about audit schedules, ration manipulations, and Authority operations
- Morally complex—every use of authority is weighted with past sins

#### **Cons**
- Hunted by former colleagues once betrayal is discovered
- Party may initially distrust you (auditors are universally hated)
- Difficult to roleplay "reformed villain" without coming across as preachy or guilt-ridden
- Limited in direct combat compared to dedicated fighter classes
- Constant tension between wanting to help and being reminded of harm you caused

#### **Example Backstory: Sera Vex**
Sera was a third-generation Auditor—her grandmother measured spark rations during the Godswar, her mother during the reconstruction. Serving the Catalyst Authority was family tradition, civic duty, and the path to a comfortable life above the block-level squalor.

She was good at her job. Efficient. Fair within the regulations. She denied rations to flagged individuals without question because the Authority's wands didn't lie—spark irregularities meant danger, contamination, uncontrolled magic that could cascade into disaster.

Then she flagged an eight-year-old girl.

The wand sang when it passed near the child—a soft harmonic indicating latent catalyst resonance. Standard protocol: immediate sequestration, Authority custody, "evaluation and treatment." Sera wrote the order. The mother begged. Sera cited regulations and moved to the next scan.

Three days later, she broke protocol and checked the Authority's sequestration files. The girl was listed as "processed"—her spark-touched blood harvested, refined, and sold as premium catalyst material. Voluntary designation: negative. Recovery prognosis: terminal.

Sera walked out of the Authority office with her wand and a copy of the sequestration database. She hasn't been back. The Authority calls her a thief and traitor. The blocks call her a monster trying to buy redemption with stolen credentials.

She joined the crew because they needed someone who knows how the Authority thinks—where they patrol, how they audit, what triggers their algorithms. But every time she uses her wand to help, she sees that little girl's face and wonders if stolen justice is justice at all.

### 5. **The Krox Trade Liaison/Cultural Translator**
*"Dragons in suits are still dragons. But they pay exceptionally well."*

#### **Core Concept**
A human who works for the Krox Trade Mission—those dragons-in-suits buying up shipyards, politicians, and influence. You're the face that makes their predatory economics look like legitimate business, the translator who makes cultural domination sound like partnership. But you've started noticing inconsistencies in their ledgers...

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Fire or Spirit
- **Fire:** Cultural connection to dragon-kind, wielding draconic fire-magic, understanding their forge-heart philosophy
- **Spirit:** Diplomatic empath, reading intentions, negotiating souls/contracts, detecting lies in corporate speak

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Diplomatic Balance:** He's uncomfortable with politics; you navigate them effortlessly
- **Resource Access:** Your Krox connections provide funding, gear, and information the crew needs
- **Cultural Knowledge:** You understand dragon culture and post-Godswar power dynamics he might not
- **Ethical Tension:** His philosophy accepts entropy; your employers are actively exploiting it for profit

#### **Pros**
- Fascinating social role with built-in moral complexity
- Access to high-level faction resources and political intelligence
- Unique character type rarely seen in TTRPGs
- Natural party "face" for negotiations and social encounters
- Potential for dramatic betrayal arc (either you betraying Krox or them betraying you)

#### **Cons**
- Requires careful roleplay to avoid feeling like "traitor waiting to happen"
- Party may distrust Krox connections, limiting character integration
- Complex political knowledge required from player and GM
- Combat utility depends heavily on dragon-gifted resources/magic
- Walking ethical minefield—every Krox deal has invisible costs

#### **Example Backstory: Marcus Rhen**
Marcus grew up in the shadow of the shipyards, watching hulls slide into orbit carrying away Ternus's resources while the blocks starved. When the Krox Trade Mission opened offices in the executive spire, he applied as a translator—not because he knew their language, but because he was hungry enough to learn.

The dragons saw potential: a human who understood scarcity, loyalty, and the price of survival. They taught him their fire-tongue, dressed him in suits that cost more than his family's yearly ration, and put him in meetings where billion-credit deals were sealed with ritual flame and handshakes that could crush bones.

Marcus became their bridge to humanity—the smiling face that made economic colonization look like opportunity. He negotiated labor contracts that bound dockers to Krox-owned yards for generations. He sold shipyard stakes to dragon lords who paid in spark-caps and political favors. He watched his own people thank him for deals that would enslave their grandchildren.

Then he found the secondary ledger—the one tracking not just money, but spark-touched individuals. The Krox weren't just buying infrastructure; they were cataloging bloodlines, mapping magic potential, building something vast and patient across human space.

He hasn't reported the ledger to his employers. He hasn't destroyed it either. Instead, he's helping this crew—still wearing the suit, still taking Krox money—trying to understand what's being built before it's too late to stop it.

Every deal he makes, he wonders: Am I a spy, or just a well-paid collaborator pretending to have principles?

### 6. **The Relic Scrapper/Tech Savant**
*"Everything old becomes new if you know which wires to cross."*

#### **Core Concept**
A scavenger and tinkerer who salvages magitech from derelict ships and makes it work again. You see potential in ruins, opportunity in junk heaps, and solutions in components everyone else calls garbage. Some call you an engineer; you call yourself an artist with a soldering iron and questionable safety standards.

#### **Aspect Recommendation:** Air or Fire
- **Air:** Quick thinking, improvised solutions, lightning-fast repairs mid-crisis
- **Fire:** Forge-worker philosophy, transforming trash into treasure, creative destruction

#### **Synergy with Kaelith**
- **Perfect Partnership:** He identifies what relics *were*; you figure out what they can *become*
- **Salvage Team Dynamic:** He clears corruption from ancient tech; you rebuild it into useful tools
- **Shared Passion:** Both fascinated by old magic/tech, just from different angles
- **Complementary Skills:** His knowledge + your craftsmanship = unstoppable relic hunters

#### **Pros**
- Constant mechanical utility—you keep ship and gear running
- Natural treasure-hunter gameplay (always looking for salvage and components)
- Creative problem-solving role—jury-rigging solutions when "proper" tools aren't available
- Great for humor and dramatic moments (will this explode or save us? Both?)
- Resource generator—you turn trash into tradeable assets

#### **Cons**
- Can feel overshadowed if Kaelith already fills "tech expert" niche
- Requires active GM support (providing salvage opportunities and component crafting systems)
- May spend significant downtime on crafting instead of group activities
- Risk of becoming "tool vending machine" for party instead of developed character
- Improvised tech failures can derail missions if not carefully balanced

#### **Example Backstory: Jax "Whisper" Coltraine**
Jax learned young that the difference between trash and treasure is mostly marketing. She grew up in the salvage district where derelict ships were stripped for parts, and parts became black-market magic for those who couldn't afford Authority licenses.

Her father ran a scrap operation—pulling reactor cores, nav systems, and weapon arrays from abandoned hulls, then selling to whoever asked the right questions. Jax was six when she first heard a broken relic hum. Her father told her that was the machine dying. She insisted it was trying to talk.

By fifteen, she'd developed a reputation: bring Whisper your broken magic, and she'd make it sing again. She coaxed life from cracked catalyst cores, taught dead sensors to see, and once rebuilt a ship's AI from corrupted memory fragments and three favors from a Void cultist.

Her gift wasn't scholarship—she never finished technical school. It was intuition, the sense that magic and machinery weren't different things but different languages describing the same conversation. She'd place her hands on a ruined relic and *feel* how it wanted to work, what it had been, what it could become.

The Catalyst Authority noticed. They offered her a licensed position, generous salary, official sanction to work with restricted tech. She declined. They audited her workshop three times, found nothing actionable, and flagged her for "future evaluation."

She joined the crew because they had access to places the Authority couldn't search, relics that didn't exist in official databases, and—most importantly—they didn't ask uncomfortable questions when she talked to machines like they were people.

Because sometimes, they talked back.

## Party Synergy Analysis

### What the Party Has (with Kaelith)
- **Relic Knowledge:** Deep understanding of ancient magitech and Godswar artifacts
- **Destruction/Control:** Void and Fire magic for combat and obstacle removal
- **Cultural Perspective:** Outsider view (Shayan exile) providing unique insights
- **Philosophical Depth:** Contemplative character balancing action with reflection

### What the Party Needs
1. **Medical/Support:** Someone to heal, stabilize, and keep crew functional
2. **Navigation/Intel:** Scout, navigator, or information specialist for planning
3. **Social Face:** Negotiator, diplomat, or con-artist for non-combat encounters
4. **Mechanical Support:** Engineer/tech to maintain ship and equipment
5. **Grounding Force:** Someone deeply connected to the block, providing emotional stakes
6. **Tactical Tank:** Front-line defender to protect squishy casters/support

### Best Synergy Options
1. **Soulsmith Medic** — Complements Kaelith's destroyer role with rebuilder/healer, opposite philosophy creates great character moments
2. **Void Navigator** — Shares magical language with Kaelith, creates expert infiltration team, philosophically aligned
3. **Union Enforcer** — Provides everything Kaelith lacks: direct action, social connection, physical defense, moral clarity

## Additional Considerations

### Thematic Considerations

**Power Dynamics:** Every character in this campaign navigates the question "What do you do when you have power in a system of scarcity?" Choose an archetype that gives you interesting answers:
- Soulsmith: Break rules to save lives
- Navigator: Know secrets, choose who learns them
- Enforcer: Physical power protecting the powerless
- Auditor: Authority power turned against corrupt system
- Krox Liaison: Economic power exposing exploitation
- Scrapper: Creative power building alternatives

**Moral Complexity:** This isn't a heroes-vs-villains campaign. Every faction has legitimate grievances and ugly methods. Choose a character with:
- Clear values that will be challenged
- Relationships that will become complicated
- Skills that create ethical dilemmas
- Background that puts you on multiple sides of conflicts

### Practical Advice

**Character Creation Conversation:**
Before finalizing, discuss with your GM:
1. **Block Connections:** Who in Block 19 matters to your character? (family, patients, union members, debts)
2. **Faction Standing:** Which factions do you trust, distrust, or owe favors to?
3. **Red Lines:** What won't your character compromise on? (This creates dramatic tension)
4. **Secret:** What's one thing about your past you haven't told the crew? (Builds mystery and reveals)

**Starting Questions:**
- What was your worst day before joining this crew?
- Why do you need this job specifically? (Money isn't enough—what's the real reason?)
- What do you do during downtime shifts?
- How do you feel about breaking the law for the right reasons?

**Tone Calibration:**
This campaign balances:
- **Grim:** Scarcity, moral dilemmas, people dying from systemic failure
- **Cinematic:** Heists, starship chases, miracle-tech moments
- **Hopeful:** Community resilience, found family, making a difference

Choose a character who can navigate all three. Pure grimdark or pure optimism will struggle.

### Playing Well with Kaelith

**Good Character Dynamics:**
- **Complementary Skills:** You do what he can't (social, healing, navigation, etc.)
- **Philosophical Contrast:** Challenge his detachment with passionate engagement
- **Shared Interests:** Both fascinated by magic/tech, just different approaches
- **Emotional Balance:** Provide warmth/humor to his brooding intensity

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't compete for "mysterious exile" archetype—that's his thing
- Don't try to out-magic him—collaborate instead of compete
- Avoid being solely his sidekick—you're a co-protagonist
- Don't solve his emotional arc for him—support, don't fix

**Great Interaction Moments:**
- You asking practical questions about relics while he waxes philosophical
- Him explaining Void theory while you're elbow-deep fixing something
- You dragging him into social situations he'd avoid
- Him providing the "why" while you provide the "how"

**Trust Your Instincts:**
Which character made you think "Oh, I want to play *that*"? That's probably the right choice.

---

*Good hunting, Spark.*

*The block needs you. The crew needs you. And Kaelith needs someone to remind him that endings aren't the only story worth telling.*
