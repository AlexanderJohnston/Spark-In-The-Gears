# Campaign Expectations: Let's Talk About Our Game

Hey everyone,

Before we dive deeper into *Spark in the Gears*, I want to have an open conversation about what kind of game we're running and what you all want from it. I've been thinking about the style and tone that fits this campaign, and I want to make sure we're all on the same page—or adjust course if needed.

## What Is This Campaign About?

At its heart, **Magitech Chronicles** was designed for **cinematic, high-stakes storytelling**. Think fast-paced space opera meets street-level heists, where your choices reshape the world and the narrative moves like a good action movie. But before I lean into that fully, I want to check: **Is that what you want?**

Here's what I mean by "cinematic play" and why I think it fits this setting. Tell me if any of this rubs you the wrong way or if there's something you'd rather see instead.

## What "Cinematic" Means for This Campaign

### Player Agency
**You directly shape the world and narrative—not just react to my prompts.**

You have narrative control. If you want to fly your ship in a clever orbital pattern to stay outside gun tracking, you can. If you want to push magic in a creative way that isn't on a spell list, you can. If you want to shoot a door panel to cause it to fail, it will. Shoot a cryo barrel and it explodes.

This is important because **you're in a war**. Not every NPC needs a health bar and an initiative check. Some scenes will be about clever solutions, daring gambles, and dramatic choices—not just dice rolls.

**You share control with me as the GM.** If you have a cool idea for how a scene should unfold, pitch it. If you want your character to have a connection to a faction or NPC, tell me. The world bends toward interesting stories.

### Narrative Over Rules
**The story takes center stage. Rules serve the narrative rather than constrain it.**

Lists of spells and martial attacks are **strong suggestions**, not hard boundaries. Magic and technology can be pushed with creativity. Want to jury-rig a spark capacitor to overload an enemy ship's shields? Let's figure out what that looks like. Want to use your life magic to stabilize a crumbling structure long enough for refugees to escape? Awesome—let's make it dramatic.

I'll bend or simplify rules for dramatic effect when it serves the story. That doesn't mean the rules don't matter—they're the foundation—but they won't get in the way of a great moment.

### High Stakes and Cinematic Moments
**Scenes are designed to feel like movie moments with big reveals, emotional beats, and heroic risks.**

Gods can shift a war on a whim. Consequences are massive: a failed battle can lead to the loss of an entire planet. A desperate heist can save your block—or doom it.

Expect:
- **Big emotional beats**: Your backstories, motivations, and relationships matter.
- **Heroic risks**: You'll face impossible odds, and sometimes the only way forward is to bet everything.
- **Dramatic reveals**: The truth about sparks, Catalysts, the war, and the gods will unfold through play—and it won't all be pretty.

## What This Means for You

If we lean into this cinematic style, here's what to expect:

### Collaborative Storytelling
You'll co-create the plot with me and the other players. Your character's goals, fears, and relationships drive the story as much as the factions and gods vying for power.

### Character Depth Over Optimization
Backstories, motivations, and relationships matter **more** than min-maxed stats. I want to know:
- What does your character care about?
- What would they die for?
- What line won't they cross?

Don't get me wrong—cool builds and clever tactics are fun! But the story comes first.

### Rule Flexibility
I may bend or simplify rules for dramatic effect. If that bothers you, let's talk about it. I want you to feel like the system supports your ideas, not limits them.

### Spotlight Sharing
Everyone gets cinematic moments to shine. If you're worried about being overshadowed or not getting your chance, tell me. I'll make sure every character has their time in the spotlight.

## Questions for You

Before we go further, I want to hear from you:

1. **Does this cinematic style sound fun to you?** Or would you prefer something more tactical, rules-heavy, or grounded?

2. **What do you want more of?** High-stakes action? Deep character moments? Political intrigue? Exploration and discovery?

3. **What do you want less of?** Combat slogs? Rule debates? Overwhelming complexity?

4. **Are there any hard lines for you?** Things you definitely want to avoid or see included?

5. **What kind of moments do you want to have in this campaign?** Give me an example of a scene or story beat that would make this game amazing for you.

## A Note on Stakes and Safety

This campaign deals with some heavy themes: scarcity, war, systemic oppression, body horror (via spark sickness and mutations), and moral compromises. I want those themes to land without making anyone uncomfortable at the table.

We'll use **safety tools** (lines, veils, rewinds) to make sure we can tell a gritty, emotionally resonant story without crossing anyone's boundaries. If something comes up in play that doesn't feel right, we'll pause and adjust. No questions asked.

## Let's Talk

Take some time to think about this, and let's discuss it before our next session. I'm excited about this campaign, and I want to make sure it's the game **you** want to play—not just the one I have in my head.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

— Your GM
