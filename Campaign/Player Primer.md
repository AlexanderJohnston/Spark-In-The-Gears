Title: Sparks in the Gears — A Ternus Primer (Player Edition)

What you know
- “Sparks” power everything: lights, medtech, ships. They’re rationed fuel refined from Catalysts and shipped in armored containers.
- Ternus runs on industry and grit. Magic is real, but most folks access it through interfaces, implants, and ship-cores.
- The Void is a dangerous shortcut between worlds; flame readers and shadow charts keep you from vanishing into it.

What you can do
- Pick a specialty (archetype vibe): Tech Mage, Relic Runner, Shipbreaker, Spellsniper, Catalyst Auditor, Soulsmith, Void Warden, Pilot/Sensor Savant.
- Choose an Aspect flavor: Life, Fire, Air, Earth/Nature, Spirit, Dream, Void, Light. It colors your miracles and gear tricks.
- You’re a ship-rated crew with debts, a block to protect, and a shot at something bigger.

How the world works (public understanding)
- Catalysts are the remains of dead gods. Refineries extract usable spark-fuel for infrastructure and starships.
- Sparks are treated like a commodity: measured, rationed, taxed, and stolen.
- Factions fight over supply: Procurement Bureaus, Shipwrights, Catalyst Authority, Soulsmith collectives, Void nav syndicates, church clinics, cartel smugglers.

Rumors from the block
- “Spark sickness” changes people: eyes like pilot lights, voices with a chorus.
- Auditors can “read” you with a wand and deny your rations for a week.
- Some kids light lamps by humming when the power cuts.

Tone & themes
- Cinematic heists, hard choices, and miracle-tech in a world of scarcity. Power solves problems…and creates bigger ones.

Starting situation
- The power company cut ration lines to your megablock. A fixer offers a “redistribution” job: hijack a spark shipment meant for an off-world battleship and divert it to your block. Two other parties want it too. What could go wrong?

Table expectations
- Fast action, meaningful downtime (tinker, treat, bribe, research), and faction consequences.
- You don’t need prior lore; we’ll reveal truth through play.
