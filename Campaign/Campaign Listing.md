Title: Sparks in the Gears — A Magitech Chronicles campaign on Ternus

Tagline
Starships, miracles, and hard choices in a hive-world built on borrowed divinity.

Introduction
Ternus is a near–hive world that never sleeps. Megablocks stack into the smog, shipyards grind without pause, and the planet's grid gulps "spark" like a starving god. On paper, the Confederacy keeps the lights on. In truth, procurement quotas, ration cuts, and quiet wars between guilds, auditors, and cartels decide who gets heat and who shivers in the dark.

Magic exists, but most Ternans only touch it through interfaces and implants. Sparks, what powers everything, are treated like bottled fuel pulled from the corpses of dead gods and pumped into grids, clinics, and warships. Some say sparks are just fuel. Others whisper that sometimes a lamp will flicker to life when a child hums.

You are a crew with a ship, debts, and a neighborhood worth fighting for. This is science-fantasy heist play: cinematic action, scarcity-driven choices, starship moments that matter, and miracles woven into tech.

Plot Hook (Session 1 — Canon)
- A war‑era **Inuran stealth freighter** is found derelict in the asteroid belt near Ternus.
- **Asha** is hired on suspiciously generous terms to **tow the ship intact** to dock (temporary legal custodianship granted by contract).
- **Kaelith** arrives separately on a **salvage contract**, boarding with a small crew to grab portable high‑value gear.
- Conflicting claims collide at the wreck, the tow begins under pressure, and the situation escalates into a catastrophe at the docks.

What you'll see in the first few sessions [ EXAMPLES - NOT MANDATORY ]
- Session 1: The Derelict Tow Job
  - Rival salvage crew already aboard; tow vs. breach; portable loot race.
  - Docking security response and a disastrous blast event.
  - Deal (or standoff) between Asha and Kaelith in the aftermath.

- Session 2: Escape & Refit
  - A hurried return to dock to refit and get out of system.
  - Early decisions about what to keep, what to sell, and who to trust.

- Session 3: New Texas Fence & Crew
  - Quietly offloading stolen war‑cargo through a gray‑market quartermaster.
  - Hiring a merc outfit for a Catalyst run without revealing the real intel source.

- Session 4: Aashitak (Dream Catalyst) Run
  - Umbral transit, approach through the husk, ground insertion, dreamfield traps.
  - Catalyzation and a catastrophic Guardian escalation.

Setting and mindset
- Tone: Cinematic, street‑level to orbital stakes. Heists, extractions, and moral dilemmas where two "rights" collide.
- Themes: Scarcity and leverage; community vs. control; power that solves problems and creates bigger ones.
- Magic + Tech: Miracles integrate with starship roles and gear. Expect flame‑reading navigation, spell‑augmented cannons, reactor rituals, and relic interfaces.
- Progression: Your choices awaken potential, alter reputations, and put bigger players on your tail.

Factions in play (expect to meet 4–6 early)
- Confederacy Procurement Bureau: quotas, audits, and weaponized paperwork.
- Ternus Shipwrights Guild: owns drydocks, unions, and elections; corrupt but essential.
- Internal Security (InSec): stings, memory‑conditioning, deniable operations.
- Catalyst Authority (CatAuth): licenses, seizures, laboratories with too‑quiet hallways.
- Soulsmith Collective: miracle tech and necrotech straddling the line between salvation and horror.
- Church of Voria Remnants: clinics, triage miracles, and a quiet vision for renewal.
- Void Nav Syndicates: flame readers, shadow charts, half cartographer, half cult.
- Krox Trade Mission: dragons in suits, buying shipyards and politicians.

Lifestyles and ways of making a living on Ternus
- Shipyard Riveter or Drydock Rigger: union dues, hazard pay, rumors before they hit the feeds.
- Spark Line Runner: hauling charge‑caps through underhive corridors; sometimes the lights follow you.
- Soulsmith Tech: patching clinic cores and whispering to living machines; side work cleaning "spark sickness."
- Flame‑Reader Navigator: reading engine fire like weather; guilds fight over your charts.
- Catalyst Auditor: badge, wand, and the power to starve a district... if you can sleep at night.
- Relic Scrapper: peeling miracles from dead hulls; sell to the highest bidder before it sings back.
- Void Cartographer: mapping safe shadow lanes; you know which doors are there only at midnight shifts.
- Dockside Fixer/Smuggler: moving crates with the right seals; keeping three ledgers and a prayer.
- Church Clinic Orderly: ration miracles to save the many; carry that weight home after every shift.
- Union Enforcer: keep the lines moving, keep your people fed, and keep management honest by any means.

Character concepts (no book knowledge needed)
- Tech Mage who overlays miracles on systems in the heat of a breach.
- Relic Runner who steals, studies, and sometimes befriends artifacts.
- Shipbreaker who turns starship hulls into weapons and cover mid‑fight.
- Spellsniper who threads miracles through coil‑rifle shots.
- Catalyst Auditor with a conscience (or a quota to hit).
- Soulsmith medic engineering life‑saving "forbidden" solutions.
- Void Warden who reads a room like a shadow map.
- Pilot/Sensor Savant who can make a tram dance and a destroyer miss.

Playstyle and expectations
- Fast action, meaningful downtime: tinker, research, bribe, treat, and build networks.
- Faction consequences: every job moves clocks; every ally has an agenda.
- Safety: consent for memory tampering and body‑change themes; rewinds for unintended mutation outcomes; we'll calibrate "grim vs. cinematic" together.

System vibes (light touch)
- Cinematic dice‑pool style with strong archetype flavor.
- Tracks for power and cost: think "Innate potential vs. exposure to the stuff that runs the grid."
- Starship roles matter every session: Pilot (position), Sensor (intel), Engineer (heat), Gunner (alpha), Captain (tempo), Mage (miracle overlay).

Ready to board?
Tell me:
- Your preferred archetype vibe and Aspect flavor.
- One tie to the block you don't want to lose.
- One faction you trust (for now) and one you don't.

Slots are limited. The grid is hungry. Bring a spark.
