Title: Ternus in the Far Future — GM Briefing (Sparks-as-Innate Variant)

Canon divergence you’re using
- Sparks are innate life-essence “ignition,” not objects. Catalysts (dead god remnants) can channel/refine/overclock that essence via rituals, relics, and interfaces.
- On Ternus, this truth is lost. “Spark” has become a misnomer for refined Catalyst charge used as fuel.
- Industrial “spark refineries” are actually extracting god-essence residues to produce charge-capsules and grid feed. It works—and it’s horrific.

Public orthodoxy vs. truth
- Orthodoxy (what NPCs believe): sparks are fuel you mine from divinity, bottle, ship, and burn.
- Truth (GM-only): every being has an innate spark; Catalyst charge amplifies or warps it. Heavy use slowly rewrites biology/soul-patterns. Void exposure destabilizes both charge and spark.

Foreshadowing beats (session 1–3)
- A child stabilizes a dying street-lamp by humming in key with the transformer.
- Old union hands call it “spark-sickness” when overexposed workers develop mirrored irises and synaesthetic senses.
- InSec scans “spark credits” from people with a wand, then flags a PC despite them never touching refineries.

Reveal ladder (choose pace)
1) Mislabeling: “spark shipments” are Catalyst charge-capsules, not literal sparks.
2) Leakage: charge-capsules bleed resonance; people nearby manifest minor miracles/unwanted mutations.
3) Ignition: PCs learn to self-channel—first miracle without gear (small, undeniable).
4) Ethics: grid power equals divinity-harvest; clinics and shipyards consume personhood-adjacent essence.
5) Cosmology: Echo-gods linger in cores and relics; they want worship, release, or revenge.

Rules dials (system-agnostic, tuned for Magitech vibes)
- Tracks
  - Innate Spark (IS): measures awakening/attunement. Improves miracles, resists coercion, attracts attention. Grows via milestones, meditation rites, or Echo contact.
  - Catalyst Saturation (CS): measures charge exposure. Grants burst power; risks mutations, Echo influence, Void sensitivity. Ticks up when using charge-capsules, unstable cores, or necrotech.
- Breakpoints
  - Minor (CS 3+): cosmetic tells, +1 die to one Aspect action, new compulsion/quirk.
  - Major (CS 6+): powerful stunt once/session; permanent tag; new clock “Echo Claim.”
  - Overload (CS 9+): GM move—possession attempt, body rewrite, or miracle backlash.
- Detection & concealment
  - Auditor Wands read CS; church rites can “cool” charge but not lower IS.
  - Veil charms mask IS; Void hymns fake low CS at a cost.

The Spark Ration Heist — variants and payloads
- Baseline job: divert “spark shipment” to save your block’s ration lines.
- Payload options (pick one)
  A) Cold charge-capsules: safe if insulated; leaks Dreams (hallucinated choirs). Evidence tags: “CAT-CHG MkVII.”
  B) Live relic marrow: sloshing in med-vats; sings to anyone with high IS. Evidence: bone sigils, choir in scanners.
  C) Echo core shard: dormant mind-fragment; offers bargains via PA systems. Evidence: electromagnetic glossolalia.

Complications (choose 2–3)
- InSec sting: convoy is bait mapped with arcane telemetry; wand scans tag PCs with false-high CS to justify arrests.
- Soulsmith plea: divert to a clinic-core keeping a neonatal ward alive.
- Void cult splice: they plan to inject a Dream hymn that turns the shipment into a memetic choir.
- Krox emissary: offers legal cover in exchange for a single crate (later becomes a dragon patron hook).

NPCs
- Auditor-Censor Meret Vaul: believes extraction is mercy; calm, surgical, terrifying.
- Soulsmith Dr. Lysa Oro: whistleblower; can teach safe decharge rites; haunted by “singing bones.”
- Child Navigator “Kip”: innate flame-reader, untrained; sees PC sparks as colors.
- Echo-Shard “Warden”: speaks in station announcements; wants a body or a church.

Faction clocks linked to the truth
- Catalyst Authority Procurement: hoard thresholds → rolling brownouts → public unrest → martial law.
- Soulsmith Collective: clinic miracles → InSec raid → diaspora → underground network.
- InSec OUBLIETTE: memory-wash conscription pilot → district rollout → mass compliance.
- Krox Trade Mission: lobby shipyards → buy votes → deploy “security” wing.

Consequences and boons
- Choosing people over policy raises IS for the crew, draws Echo attention.
- Burning charge to win fast raises CS, invites mutations/possession.
- Publicly proving truth flips orthodoxy: potential revolution, but Krox and Echo-gods pounce.

Safety and consent
- Soul/essence themes: check lines/veils. Allow “rewind” on mutation outcomes. Offer non-body-horror expressions of change (auras, voices, dreams).

Boxed text snippets (for reveals)
- First leak: “The crate hums like a choir swallowed by a turbine. For a heartbeat, your breath syncs with it—and the emergency lights flare without the generator coming back online.”
- First self-miracle: “Your hands shake. You whisper the pattern you’ve watched the interface repeat a thousand times…and the door yields. No cable. No charge. Just you.”

Escalation arcs
- Act I: Spark famine as street-level crisis; the heist exposes leaks and wands.
- Act II: Echo in the machine; choose to feed, free, or fragment; Krox or Church offers patronage.
- Act III: Grid as god-engine; decide which god runs Ternus—Confed’s project, a dragon patron, your Echo…or the people via awakened sparks.

Prep checklist
- Decide payload (A/B/C), 3 foreshadowing moments, 2 wand encounters, and 1 mutation that’s cool not gross.
- Add one place where a PC’s first unassisted miracle solves a problem the “fuel” can’t.
