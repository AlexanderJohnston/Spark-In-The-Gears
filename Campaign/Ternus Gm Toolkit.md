Title: Sparks in the Gears — GM Briefing (Actual-Play Canon)

What this document is
- This is a GM-only briefing aligned to the **Session Logs** (Sessions 1–4).
- If this ever conflicts with a Session Log, the log wins.

Campaign spine (Sessions 1–4)
- **Session 1**: Derelict Inuran stealth freighter in the belt; Asha’s tow contract vs Kaelith’s salvage crew; armory breach; dock catastrophe; uneasy alliance.
- **Session 2**: Refit and escape planning; acquiring a spelldrive/spell cannon; first use of Umbral transit; the dream scale intel becomes a long-term secret.
- **Session 3**: New Texas (Lone Star Station) fencing; Maris “Ledger” Konn; hire Black Trace (Rho, Mudcat, Lysa, Tamsin).
- **Session 4**: Aashitak run; ground insertion into the husk; dreamfield trap; catalyzation; Guardian escalation; cliffhanger with Kaelith’s armor weapon.

Factions / recurring pressure points
- **Ternus dock authority & marines**: respond hard to perceived piracy; became collateral during the dock catastrophe.
- **Inuran trade moon interests**: the original tow contract implies a powerful buyer; motives unclear.
- **New Texas gray-market**: laundering and quiet sale of war cargo through Maris.
- **Catalyst-chasers / merc outfits**: Black Trace as the first hired crew; more may emerge after Session 4 fallout.

Key canon facts established in play
- The derelict freighter carried a **war cache**: spell armor, spellrifles/pistols, medical supplies, high-grade munitions, stealth coating kit, and blank dream dragon scales.
- The **dream scale** used for navigation contains a Catalyst map and was kept secret as “reliable intel.”
- **Aashitak** is a Dream catalyst (Divinity 25) with pervasive dreamfield effects and a lethal Guardian.

GM-only state at end of Session 4 (for Session 5 start)
- **Known survivors**: Asha, Kaelith, Lysa, Rho, Tamsin (Mudcat confirmed dead in-session; most of Black Trace killed).
- **Asha’s ship**: crushed by the Guardian’s claw at the cliffhanger moment (cargo already unloaded earlier).
- **Kaelith’s armor**: revealed a large-area siphon/weapon system; Kaelith chose to fire the beam into open space (resolution begins next session).
- **Catalyzation**: Asha and Kaelith gained Dream magic and Essence Sight (per log).

Session 5 immediate threads (carry-forward)
- Resolve the beam’s consequence (what it hits, what it costs Kaelith, what it does to the Guardian’s control net).
- Extraction plan without Asha’s ship (commandeer Black Trace ship, improvise shelter, or negotiate the impossible).
- How the Guardian reacts to the armor’s interference now that the party is catalyzed.
