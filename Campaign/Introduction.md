They cut the lights at shift-bell.

Not all at once. First, the hallway strips went thin and blue. Then, the lifts groaned to a stop between floors, and the kitchen coils died while the kettle was half-singing. You don't realize how loud the block is until the grid stops chewing. After that there's just breath, boots, and the old pipes ticking like a Geiger.

We open the shutters to let the shipyard glow in. It isn't light, not really, more a smear of weld-fire bleeding through the smog like a tired sunrise. The drydocks are scaffolding and ghosts out past the stack-lines and hulls, like cliff faces etched with names I can't afford to read. The Grid Office says it's a "temporary ration line-adjustment" because The Confederacy needs to fulfill a military priority. The feeds show another shiny new destroyer sliding into orbit like a knife. The block shows candle light and arguments.

Down on 19, the Church clinic runs on fumes. The Sisters pull miracles out of a battery older than my mother's bad knee. They triage with soft hands and hard rules. The AutoForge tech with the shaved head tells me they can keep the neonatal ward alive for maybe a half-shift on what's left. She asks if anyone saw the Auditors; if the wands were out. I say they were: three of them at the tram, tapping wrists and eyes, polite like enclosed blades. People held their breath when the wand passed, like not breathing would make them unreadable.

We're renters under twenty different landlords but it's all one block when the grid dies. Even the Enforcers put away the batons and pick up buckets. Someone runs a line from a portable carring the whine of a little turbine and bitter stink of improvised fuel. We triage power. Coil for the clinic, charge for the emergency comms, nothing for entertainment. The woman from 23C hums to keep her baby from crying and the busted strip over her door flickers in time, like it's trying to remember how to be a light. We pretend not to notice. You don't talk about that. You don't report it either. Not to Auditors, not to anyone.

By third bell a fixer slides through, all smiles and sleeves too clean for our stairs. Says there's a "redistribution" job making the rounds. Nothing dramatic, just a shipment meant for an off-world battleship that happened to take the long way round. Move it off the tram, point it somewhere useful. Our somewhere. He keeps his hands where we can see them and his words where they sound like hope. He says the crates are sealed charge-caps, armored, stable, hardly sing at all unless you're the nervous type. He says it like people don't hear things these days.

The rumors did the rounds even before the lights went. Tournament talk, like kids betting on which faction will blink. Procurement holds the inventory and the keys, Shipwrights run the docks and the votes, InSec is a rumor with a budget, the Catalyst Authority owns the seals, and the Guild says nobody touches the shipyard cores, not even the gods we borrowed them from. The Void Syndicates passed through last week with shadow charts and eye tattoos; I didn't look long. Somebody said they mapped new eddies in the old tram tunnels, little pockets where your breath fogs and your watch stutters like a heartbeat. Somebody else said dragons in suits bought a floor down by the south cranes. They always look like they're humoring gravity.

I work the Lines usually, moving crates through corridors that were designed by engineers who hated straight lines. I'm decent with tags and locks. I know enough to listen to the cargo like it might answer back. We all pretend our lives are explained by paperwork, that a seal is a prayer and a barcode is faith. But I've heard a crate hum like a choir swallowed by machinery. I've seen weld-light bend around a relic like it didn't want to touch. I've watched a Sister put two fingers on a child's temple and take a pain into herself like it was freight. You don't tell stories like that at the canteen unless you want a wand in your face and a week without rations.

The fixer talks numbers. He knows exactly how many hours of heat it takes to keep a block from turning mean. He knows what it looks like when people choose between a clinic and a kitchen. His eyes skip when someone mentions InSec. There's a rumor they're baiting crews with decoy shipments, mapping smuggling rings with arcane telemetry baked into the seals. There's another rumor that the Catalyst Authority will trade licenses for signatures and silence. There's always a rumor that the Guild will make it right for dues and blood.

On the tram platform, the boilers still burn even when the grid doesn't. The flame-readers stand with their hands out like street preachers, reading the past or future. They won't talk to you much, but they can be paid. They glance once and tell you if today is a day the tunnels go where they always go, or if today is a day they go somewhere else. I've paid for that answer more than for food. Some days a map is better than bread.

When the ration cut hits, the block breathes together by habit. We pass water up the stairs in chains, we tape windows against the ash, we set a table on the landing with what can be shared and we keep a shelf behind the panel for what can't. We are at our best when we're afraid and at our worst when we're tired. The kids chase each other with dead flashlights and click their tongues like switches. The old ones sit at the windows and watch the yard, because the yard is a story that always moves. Somewhere up there a hull becomes a ship, and a ship becomes a decision.

The fixer asks if we're in. Nobody looks at me but somehow I feel asked. It's not that I believe in him. It's that I believe in mornings where the kettle sings all the way through and the lights don't have to borrow the smog's reflection to pretend they're lit. It's that I can't listen to the clinic battery gasp one more time.

I tell him I'll ride the tram. I tell him I can move a crate without waking it. I tell him I have friends who know which cranes squeal and which don't. He says good, good, like he's checking boxes on a list the block wrote for him.

Later, when the stairs are quiet and the block is counting its breaths, I pass the woman in 23C again. The strip above her door glows soft now, like dawn under water. She's asleep in a chair with the baby on her chest. I don't touch the light. I don't touch the baby. I don't touch the feeling in my chest like a pilot light trying to catch.

We don't talk about that. Not yet. We just find ways to keep the kettle singing.

Out past the smoke there are other skies. The flame-readers tell stories when they're tired enough to forget you're listening: of Shaya's gardens stitched back together with miracle thread and still bleeding sap in the winter; of shipgrave hulks where Echo‑voices bargain through broken PA systems; of Virkonna, the dragon world, and of Virkona, the storm‑mother whose name you say like a prayer or a dare depending on the wind. They say there's a war still burning where the lanes climb into blue, against the children of what remains of Virkona: storm‑kin in living armor who ride weather like rails and call lightning down into hangars. Some say they're guardians gone feral, others say they're shards of a god that won't stop being a god. Either way, ships leave our yard full of brave and come back full of holes, and The Confederacy calls it "acceptable burn."

And farther yet, beyond the colonies and whatever comes after, there's a story we tell low, the kind you taste like iron. A world swallowed by blood. They tried to bottle it, grid it, name it, contain it with red‑lattices and quarantine protocols, but the blood kept remembering new shapes to be. It climbed canals and steeples and finally the sky, rained itself back down in sheets which corrupt and twist all life. They say there are no maps to find this planet anymore. They say you can hear it bubbling and gurgling when you drift through the Void, the slow pulse of something that learned our words but knows only hunger. When rations get cut here, the feeds speak soft about "front‑line exigencies." We're supposed to nod and boil less water. Mostly we do. But sometimes, when the shipyard glow leans red and the kettle stutters on the coil, I wonder what "far away" really means.

So we keep our heads down and our sparks close. We pass rumors like blankets and watch the weld‑light for omens. The block is small, but it's ours, and until the war touches our stairs or the Gods learn our names, we'll keep the babies warm, the clinic humming, and the kettle singing.
