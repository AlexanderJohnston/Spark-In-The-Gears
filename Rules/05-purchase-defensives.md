# Purchase Defensives

## Overview
- Defenses represent how hard you are to hit or affect and how much damage you can absorb.
- Every character begins with default values and then **distributes 3 points** among innate defenses at character creation, respecting attribute caps.

## Innate Defenses
Innate defenses are checked when an attack is made; if the attack roll’s successes are **less than** the relevant defense, the attack **misses**.

### Brace
- **Limiting Attribute:** Fortitude.
- Represents toughness and the ability to shrug off physical blows.
- Commonly used against **melee** attacks and some close‑range threats.

### Dodge
- **Limiting Attribute:** Agility.
- Represents actively avoiding attacks by moving out of the way.
- Commonly used against **ranged** attacks and many area or projectile effects.

### Skepticism
- **Limiting Attribute:** Will.
- Represents mental resilience and resistance to magical influence.
- Casters must **meet or exceed** a target’s Skepticism with their spell successes to affect them.

### Allocation Rules
- Each innate defense starts at **1**.
- You receive **3 additional points** to distribute among Brace, Dodge, and Skepticism.
- No defense can be raised above its **limiting Attribute** at character creation.

## Active Defenses
Active defenses apply **after** an attack hits and reduce incoming damage.

### Armor
- Reduces damage from **kinetic and energy** sources (e.g., bullets, lasers, many physical spells).
- Each point of Armor cancels one point of incoming kinetic/energy damage.
- Some magical attacks that manifest physically can also be stopped by Armor; otherwise they are resisted by Resistances.

### Resistances
- Function like Armor but apply to **specific aspects of magic**.
- Examples include **Fire Resistance, Void Resistance, Magic Resistance**, etc.
- When hit by a spell, apply either the relevant **aspect Resistance** or **Magic Resistance** (not both) to reduce damage.
- **Magic Resistance** is rarer and more powerful because it applies to many different spells.

## Hit Points
- Hit points represent how much damage you can take before being disabled or killed.
- Base hit points are calculated as:
  - **Hit Points = (Fortitude × 5) + Archetype bonus**.
- When hit points are reduced to **0**, the character is **disabled**.
- If they then take further damage **greater than their Fortitude**, they **die**.

Use this sheet during character creation to allocate defenses and to recalculate them whenever Attributes, armor, or resistances change.
