# What the Game Is About

## Core Premise
- The Magitech Chronicles RPG is set in a galaxy where advanced technology and powerful magic coexist.
- Worlds rise and fall around scarce magical resources, especially dead gods called **Catalysts**, whose corpses are pure, harvestable magic.
- Player characters are among the rare individuals with access to magic, technology, or both, operating as adventurers in a chaotic, war-torn sector.

## Catalysts and the Circle of Eight
- **Catalysts** are the remains of gods killed in the Godswar; each Catalyst is aligned to one or more of the eight aspects: **Life, Air, Dream, Fire, Void, Earth, Spirit, Water** (the "Circle of Eight").
- Visiting a Catalyst and surviving the process creates a **Catalyzation** in a character, granting access to one or more aspects of magic, extra spell pool, elemental resistances, and sometimes special powers.
- Characters can visit multiple Catalysts over their careers, stacking power from different aspects, extending their lifespans, and edging toward demigodhood at the risk of death each time.

## Role of Magic in the Setting
- Entire cultures and galactic powers are defined by which aspects their local Catalysts grant (e.g., Life-heavy worlds produce many healers; Void-heavy worlds breed battle mages).
- Control of Catalysts drives politics and warfare; many adventures revolve around discovering, reaching, defending, or plundering a specific Catalyst.
- The balance of power between magic and technology is fluid: some societies rely almost entirely on magic, others on tech, and many (including the player characters) blend both.

## Typical Character Roles
- **True Mages** master greater paths of magic and often hunt for new Catalysts to expand their spell repertoires.
- **Tech Mages** and **War Mages** combine heavy combat prowess with spellcasting, either through spellarmor and spellrifles or through spellblades and personal channeling.
- **Scoundrels**, **Mercenaries**, and **Dedicates** fill out roles like stealth operatives, non-magical specialists with cyberware, and miracle‑granting holy warriors, giving parties a mix of magic, martial skill, and utility.
