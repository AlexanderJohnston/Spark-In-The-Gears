# Combat

## Combat Flow
- Combat is run in rounds; each character acts once per round in initiative order.
- Each character normally gets 2 actions per round (move, attack, sprint, use skills/powers, etc.).
- Round loop:

1) Roll Combat Initiative (once per combat).
2) Highest initiative acts (spend actions).
3) Go down the list until all are done/passed.
4) Start next round.

## Initiative
- Base Initiative = Agility + Archetype bonus.
- Combat Initiative = Base Initiative + d6 (re-roll at start of each combat).
- Higher Combat Initiative acts first.

## Defenses
- Innate Defenses (from character creation):

- Brace – vs. melee attacks.
- Dodge – vs. ranged attacks.
- Skepticism – vs. spells / mental / magical effects (as defined by GM).

- Active Defenses:

- Armor / Spellarmor / Racial armor: subtract from damage after a hit.
- Some enemies have resistances (e.g., void resistance) that reduce specific damage types.

## Masteries & Accuracy
- Masteries: rolls with a mastery succeed on 4, 5, or 6 (instead of just 5–6).
- Accuracy: each point of Accuracy adds +1 die to the attack roll.

## Range & Armor Penetration
- Range:

- Up to weapon range = no penalty.
- Up to 2× range = +2 difficulty (DT).
- Up to 3× range = +4 difficulty (DT).

- Armor Penetration (AP): subtracts directly from armor (min 0) before applying damage.

## Movement & Sprinting
- Move (1 action): move Agility × 2 squares/hexes (or meters/yards if abstract).
- Sprint (2 actions): move Agility × 5 squares.

- Sprinting: Brace = 0 for that round, Dodge +1.

## Attacking & Rolling to Hit
- Spend 1 action to attack, cast a spell, or attempt most skill-based actions.
- Roll Attribute + Skill in d6s (e.g., Agility 5 + Ranged 4 = 9 dice).
- Normal success: 5–6 = 1 success (or 4–6 if a mastery applies).
- If successes ≥ target’s relevant Defense, the attack hits.

- Each extra success = +1 damage.

## Damage & Downed
- Each weapon/spell has a fixed damage rating.
- Damage sequence:

1) Base damage.
2) Subtract relevant armor / resistance.
3) Apply remainder to Hit Points (HP).

- At 0 or less HP: gain Downed status (incapacitated, unconscious).

- If a downed character takes more than their Fortitude in damage while already downed, they die (this doesn’t apply to the attack that first made them downed).
- They don’t wake up until back to 1 HP.

## Lingering Damage
- Some effects (acid, fire, boiling, etc.) deal Lingering X damage over time.
- Pattern: full damage on round 1, then -1 per round until 0.

- Example: Lingering 3 → 3, 2, 1 (total 6 damage).
- Lingering 10 → total 55 damage.

## Healing & Recovery
- Natural recovery: regain Fortitude HP per day; regain all spell points per day with good rest.
- First Aid (successful check): doubles HP recovered per day.
- Magical healing is much faster and highly valuable.

## Tactical Rules
- Edge: +2 automatic successes to all attacks.

- Gained from certain skills/abilities (e.g., Scoundrels attacking unaware enemies).
- Flanking (two+ attackers where target can’t put back to a wall) grants Edge to attackers.
- Edges do not stack; +2 successes total is the max from Edge.

- Hesitating (on your turn while you have actions left):

- Remove yourself from the initiative order, banking your remaining actions.
- You can re-enter at any time, acting before anyone else on that initiative; that becomes your new permanent initiative for that combat.

- Getting the Drop (Ambush):

- If the enemy is unaware when combat starts, you get the drop.
- You and allies get a full round of actions before opponents join the initiative.

## Splitting Actions
- You may split a single action into multiple attacks/rolls:

- Divide your dice pool evenly between the actions.
- Apply a -1 die penalty per extra action to the total before splitting.
- Example: 9 dice, want 2 attacks → -1 die (for splitting) = 8 dice → 4 dice per attack.

## Common Penalties (Difficulty Modifiers)
- Reduced visibility / cover: +2 difficulty to ranged attacks.
- Blinded: +4 difficulty to all attacks.
- Prone: +2 difficulty and costs an action to stand.
- Sickened: +1 difficulty per level of severity.
- Beyond normal weapon range: +2 difficulty per additional range increment.

## Encounter Scaling
- Lesser Template (for weaker parties):

- HP: ×0.5.
- All defenses: -1 (min 1).
- Armor & resistances: -2.
- Dice pools: -3.

- Greater Template (for very strong parties / big groups):

- HP: ×1.5.
- All defenses: +1.
- Armor & resistances: +2.
- Dice pools: +3.
