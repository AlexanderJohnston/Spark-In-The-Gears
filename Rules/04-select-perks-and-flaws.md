# Select Perks & Flaws

## System Overview
- During character creation you may take up to **3 Flaws**; for each Flaw you may take **1 Perk**.
- The same Flaw or Perk cannot be selected more than once.
- Flaws do more than balance Perks: they are the **only** way to gain **Luck**, a powerful meta‑currency.

## Luck and Flaws
- Whenever you roleplay a Flaw in a way that **meaningfully harms or inconveniences** your character, the GM may award **1 Luck point**.
- A point of Luck can be spent to **reroll any failed roll** or **automatically succeed at a skill roll**, counting as **DT + 1 successes**.
- You do not have to take any Flaws, but characters without Flaws **cannot gain Luck**.

## Common Physical Flaws
- **Clumsy (−1 Agility):** You are accident‑prone; when clumsiness causes a real setback (tripping at a bad time, fumbling gear, etc.) you may earn Luck.
- **Clueless (−1 to Perception checks):** You miss obvious details; when this directly harms you (missing traps, social cues) Luck may be awarded.
- **Skipped Leg Day (−1 Strength):** Weak and easily overpowered; when lack of strength causes problems (can’t lift, can’t break something, etc.) you may gain Luck.
- **Food Allergy (−1 Fortitude):** Allergic to a common food; when an allergic reaction in play creates serious complications, you may earn Luck.
- **Missing Limb:**
  - Missing arm: cannot use two‑handed items.
  - Missing leg: movement speed halved.
  - Missing wings/tail: lose any racial gliding or flight from that limb.

## Common Social Flaws
- **Punchable Face (−1 Charisma):** People instinctively dislike you; when this gets you singled out, refused service, or otherwise hindered, Luck may be awarded.
- **Kind of a Dick (−1 to all Negotiation checks):** You radiate unlikeability; social friction that meaningfully hurts your interests may grant Luck.
- **Not in Anyone’s League (−1 Appearance):** Unattractive in a way that repels potential romantic interests; failed attempts at social or romantic engagement can yield Luck.
- **Fashion Victim (Dress Inappropriate):** Habitually dresses wrong for the situation; being refused entry, mocked, or penalized due to clothing can earn Luck.
- **Untouchable (Socially Shunned):** Your background (ex‑con, infamous relative, etc.) makes people avoid you; when social doors close because of it, you may gain Luck.

## Common Mental Flaws
- **Math is Hard (−1 Reason):** Not bright; when you miss something any normal person would understand and it causes problems, Luck may be granted.
- **Bit of a Crackhead (−1 Will):** Addicted to something (drugs, manabeer, games, etc.); when giving in to temptation hurts you, you may gain Luck.
- **Way Too Literal (−1 Intuition):** Takes everything literally; misinterpretations that cause real trouble can grant Luck.
- **P is for Phobia (Pick a Phobia):** Deathly afraid of something; whenever confronting this fear causes a significant setback, Luck may be awarded. You can take this Flaw multiple times for different phobias.
- **Kleptomaniac (Compulsive Thief):** Steals frequently under self‑defined rules; getting caught or causing mission problems through theft may grant Luck.

## Common Magic Flaws
- **Void Bolt Homing Beacon (−1 Resistance):** Magical defenses are weaker than normal; deliberately risking magical harm (standing in spellfire, etc.) can earn Luck.
- **Really Bad at This Magic Thing (−1 maximum Spell Pool):** Have 1 fewer maximum Spell Pool than otherwise; running out of Spell Pool at a critical moment may grant Luck.
- **Oops. My Bad (Technological Hex):** Technology tends to fail around you (comms dying, ship systems glitching, etc.); when this causes real problems, Luck may be awarded.
