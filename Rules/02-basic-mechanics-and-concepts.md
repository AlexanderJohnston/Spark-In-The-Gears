# Basic Mechanics & Concepts

## Dice Pools and Action Resolution
- When a character attacks, uses a skill, or attempts a significant action, they roll a number of d6 equal to **Attribute + Skill**.
- If the relevant Skill is a **Mastery**, dice showing **4–6** are successes; otherwise, only **5–6** are successes.
- The GM sets a **Difficulty Threshold (DT)** for the task; if total successes < DT the action fails, and if total successes ≥ DT the action succeeds, with each success beyond the DT adding to damage or effect as specified by the action, spell, or ability.

## Difficulty Thresholds (DT)
- **DT 1 – Simple:** Easy tasks such as basic computer research or straightforward knowledge checks.
- **DT 2 – Moderate:** Tasks requiring some focus, such as basic coding or simple device repair.
- **DT 3 – Hard:** Difficult tasks most people will fail, such as disarming a bomb on a timer or convincing an enemy to assist you.
- **DT 4 – Extreme:** Nearly impossible tasks like piloting a powerless shuttle safely through re‑entry and landing it.
- **DT 5 – Absurd:** Attempts that border on the impossible; success generally requires extraordinary circumstances, resources, or abilities.

## Edge
- **Edge** represents a strong situational advantage and provides **+2 automatic successes** on a single roll.
- Multiple sources of Edge **do not stack**; if more than one would apply, the character still only gains a total of +2 successes.
- Some abilities or defenses explicitly remove an opponent’s Edge, negating this bonus for that roll.

## Favor Dice
- The GM may award **1–3 favor dice** when a player describes their actions in a way that meaningfully enhances the narrative or scene.
- Favor dice are extra d6 added to the roll and follow the usual success rules (4+ on a Mastery, 5+ otherwise), and **stack with Edge**.
- Players are encouraged not to angle for favor purely for mechanical gain, and GMs are encouraged to deny Favor when it feels like rules‑lawyering rather than genuine roleplay.

## Luck and Flaws (System Summary)
- Characters may choose up to **3 Flaws** during character creation; each Flaw entitles them to one **Perk**, and the same Flaw or Perk cannot be taken more than once.
- **Luck** is earned only when a character voluntarily suffers from one of their Flaws in a way that meaningfully and negatively impacts them; the GM may then award **1 Luck point**.
- A Luck point can be spent to **reroll any failed roll** or to **automatically succeed at a skill roll**, counting as **DT + 1 successes** for that roll (enough to beat the threshold by 1 success).
