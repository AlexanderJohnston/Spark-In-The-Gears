# PILOTING & SPACE COMBAT CHEAT SHEET

## Key Differences from Ground Combat
- Uses the same core combat system (rounds, actions, dice, defenses), but on larger maps and with ships.
- Ships have velocity, can move in 3D (elevation), and often have shields, consoles, spellmatrices, and power cores.
- Magic (via spelldrives and spell matrices) is a major part of propulsion and combat.

## Velocity & Movement
- Each ship has a velocity rating and a base move.
- Increase/Decrease Velocity (Pilot action): spend an action to change velocity by ±1 (within ship limits).

- **Example**: Base move 10, velocity 3 → ship moves 30 squares/hexes per move.
- Once at a velocity, all movement uses that full value until you slow down; there is no gradual coast step-by-step.
- Velocity affects defense: effective Dodge = base Dodge + current velocity.

## Spell Drives & Propulsion (Magical Drives)
- Ships with magical propulsion use spelldrives linked to spell matrices and specific aspects:
- Air Drives – primarily atmospheric; can accept Dream as a substitute.
- Life Drives – plasma thrust; usable in atmosphere and space.
- Dream Drives – warp reality; very versatile but usually slower/less precise.
- Fire Drives – very common; fire-based thrust; usable in atmosphere and space.
- Void Drives – top-tier; teleportation and gravity magic; usable anywhere (even underwater).
- Earth Drives – volatile minerals as fuel; usually atmosphere and space.
- Water Drives – rare; typically underwater only.
- Spirit Drives – soul-fueled; used by Krox and necromancers.

- **Spell Matrices**:
- Magical interfaces that let mages control drives and cast through the ship.
- Some matrices are universal (any spell), others are limited (offense-only, defense-only, etc.).
- Multiple mages with universal matrices can contribute to the same spell, massively boosting magnitude.

## Elevation & 3D Space
- Space combat is tracked on a 2D map with elevation as a separate value.
- Place a die next to each vessel showing its elevation (can be positive or negative in space).
- Most fights behave mostly in 2D with minor elevation shifts; track elevation primarily for maneuvers/cover.

## Pilot Actions
- **Move**:
- Must move the full distance according to current velocity/base move unless performing a maneuver that states otherwise.
- Can spend actions to change velocity as noted above.

- **Attack**:
- Rolls resolve vs. target ship’s Dodge; on a hit, damage is first applied to Shields, then to Hull/HP.
- Beam Weapons – immediate shot-style attacks.
- Guided Weapons (missiles, torpedoes) – higher Accuracy; can be shot down or negated by defenses.
- Depletion: when a weapon fires, it becomes depleted; an action is required to recharge before it can fire again.
- Total attacks/actions per round for the ship = number of crewed consoles + spellmatrices (AIs can count as crew but still need a console).

- **Perception** (Sensors Scan):
- Spend an action to scan a target.
- DT1 – Public ID, basic info, positions.
- DT2 – Velocity, possible trajectory.
- DT3 – Trajectory, likely destinations.
- DT4+ – Technical details; DT depends on how obscure/valuable the knowledge is.

- **Accelerate/Decelerate**:
- Spend an action to change velocity by ±1.

- **Recharge**:
- The pilot gets one free recharge action each round.
- Either recharge a weapon (remove depletion) or
- Restore +25% shield HP.

- **Power Cores**:
- Each power core beyond the first grants one extra recharge action (still costs an action to use).
- More cores = more simultaneous recharges (weapons and/or shields).

## Crew Actions (using Consoles)
- **Instead of attacking, crew can do**:
- **Balance Shields** – Engineering DT2; +10% shield HP (better recharge via tuning).
- **Damage Control** – repair +10% HP to hull via system rerouting.
- **Scrounge Power** – Engineering DT4; triggers an extra recharge action, even if none remain (once per combat).
- **Repair System** – Engineering roll, DT = number of damaged systems; temporary repairs for the rest of combat (can be undone by more damage).
- **Ready Countermeasures** – Hesitate and prep countermeasures; on being attacked, Engineering roll adds successes to Dodge against that attack.
- **Lock On** – Gain weapons lock; add Engineering roll successes to all Gunnery rolls by all crew.

- **Called Shot** – Target a specific system:
- Perception DT based on system importance; attack with penalty equal to that DT.
- Roll vs. target’s Skepticism instead of Dodge.
- On success: no HP damage, but the targeted system is disabled until repaired.

- **Perception** (Scan) – same DT ladder as pilot Perception; can be done by crew as a console action.

## Combat Maneuvers (Pilot)
Each costs an action to set up/execute unless noted:

- **Barrel Roll** (prep maneuver):
- Hesitate and “ready” it. When attacked, roll Piloting; add 2× successes to Dodge.
- Requires velocity 2+.

- **Pursuit**:
- Match target’s path and stay on their tail.
- Requires you to be at +1 velocity higher than the enemy.
- Add Piloting roll successes to Gunnery attacks against that target.

- **Flip and Burn**:
- If being pursued: drop velocity by -1, perform a 180° turn, and take an immediate attack.
- Suffer -2 Dodge for this maneuver.

- **Strafe**:
- Take one attack during your move at any point in the move.
- Add Piloting successes to Gunnery.
- Requires +1 velocity higher than the enemy.

- **Taunt**:
- If in comms contact, taunt the enemy; roll Negotiation.
- Add Negotiation successes to Piloting as long as the opponent remains taunted (opposed Negotiation each round).

- **Break Off**:
- If the opponent has weapons lock, pilot can try to break it with evasive maneuvers.
- Piloting roll vs. DT equal to the lock-on bonus.

## Captain Actions
- **Rally**:
- Ship captain spends an action to inspire crew.
- +2 to all crew actions (Piloting, Gunnery, Engineering, etc.), per your table’s duration convention.
