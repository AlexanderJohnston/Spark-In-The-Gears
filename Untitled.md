Many of the GM, background, and prep materials in this repository are out of date compared to what happened in the actual game sessions.

Read through those relevant pages one at a time and search keywords in the Session Logs to see if you can find any out of date information. The Session Logs are the sources of truth, as they're what actually happened.

Write a comprehensive outline of your findings. Don't include the specific details yet. Just output the file and line number where a discrepancy is, the file and line number of the Session Log where you found the conflicting info. We will go back later and investigate them. Share your findings here in the chat.

Got it. I’m going to (1) read the **Session Logs** to establish what actually happened, then (2) go through the **GM/background/prep** pages one by one, pulling out candidate “claims” (names, outcomes, locations, NPC status, planned scenes), and (3) keyword-search the logs to confirm contradictions and record **both file+line refs** for each discrepancy.

Nice — the logs are pretty detailed and also reveal one meta-thing already: `Sessions/Session 5/Session 5 Log.md` is effectively empty right now, so any Session 5 prep/GM notes can’t be validated against a “source of truth” until that log is filled in. Next I’ll start with world/GM reference pages (like `Places/Catalyst Aashitak.md`) and cross-check each claim against the Session 1–4 logs, recording paired file+line references where they disagree.
