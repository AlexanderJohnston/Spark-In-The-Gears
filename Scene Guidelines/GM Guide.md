GAMEMASTER'S GUIDE
Running compelling stories is hard. Preparing con-
tent can be tedious, especially when players bypass
entire swathes of it. But when it all works? When you
pull together one of those amazing sessions? That's why
I play these games, the shared storytelling moments.
The entire MTC system is designed to foster story-
telling. That means the system plays a little differently
than other games you may have tried. Combat is much
faster, for one thing. You can whip through an initiative
pass in a minute or less, and an entire complex com-
bat generally doesn't take more than twenty to thirty
minutes.
Contrast that to many other games. My last group had
six players, and we'd take an average of four hours per
session. Some groups love that, and that's fine. For me,
though, I prefer combat as a vehicle for the story, not
an entire gaming mode.
Because combat flows more quickly we generally
have to prepare more combat, which I've broken down
into scenes. Before we get there, though, I want to talk a
bit about building the group. Your pre-campaign pre-
paration might be the most important thing you do.
BUILDING THE GROUP
Your first hurdle is finding players. Thankfully sites
like Roll20.net offer a way for us to gather them, and
the medium has come a long way. I've been shocked
how much fun gaming online can be.
Gathering around a table is still my favorite, though,
and I've built many a group for many a different game
over the decades. Most of the early games involved big
mistakes, and eventually I learned that not all players
are interested in the same thing.
Characters who love RP and story are generally
called narrative gamers.

Players who want the game world to be real, and
love understanding how every system works are called
simulationists.
Players who enjoy overcoming challenges like com-
bat are generally called gamists.
Most players are a mix of all three, but some skew
heavily toward one or another. The last game I played
in had two narrative gamers, four gamists, and a simu-
lationist.
If the GM fudged a roll the simulationist got upset. If
the game spent too much time in combat the narrative
gamers got upset. If the game was all RP the narrative
gamers were thrilled, but t he gamists fell alseep.
Before you start a game spell out your style. What
kind of game are you running? What kind of player are
you? Spell that out clearly to your players. "Guys, there's
probably only going to be one combat a session. Lots of
puzzles, and heavy RP."
This will attract the narrative gamers you're after,
and warn away the gamist from a game they will loathe.
If you love combat, and are honest, then narrative
gamers will know their needs aren't going to be met.
Once you've assembled 3-6 players, and given them
an idea of the tone of the game you're running, then
it's time to write an adventure.
SCENES
Scenes are incredibly straight forward, and contain
exactly what a movie scene would. You've got a cast who
is present, a setting, and some scripted events that are
going to occur in that scene. From a writing / game
master perspsective you also have a scene goal, though.
A reason the scene exists. Without all these things a
scene is not a scene.
Both of the following sagas, Dying World, and First
Contact are broken down into scenes. As a GM you use
them to navigate the story, and generally plan sessions
based on how many scenes you expect to be able to run.
I have about 4 hours to work with. I allow some warm
up banter, but we get about 3 real hours of play.
A scene generally takes me 45 minutes to run
through, so I need to prepare 5 scenes for every game
session. I only expect to get through four, but I want
more runway than the players are likely to encounter.
PLOT BRANCHING:
Often times you won't be able to predict your
players's decisions. They can and will throw a massive
wrench into your planning, so I always do some plot
branching to cover possible party decisions.
For example, in the First Contact saga your players
can choose to go with a group of necromancers, go
back to their government, or strike out on their own. I
prepared scenes for all three possible routes, and also
realized it was possible for them to do something one
of those scenes didn't cover.

• Scene Goal
Each scene is comprised of three parts, and the
scene goal is the most important. More important than
setting. More important than characters present.
The scene goal is the condition you need met by the
end of the scene. Maybe an informant is telling your
group they've been burned and are now being hunted
by the confederacy. The scene goal is "Characters learn
they've been betrayed."
If it's a combat the scene goal could be survival,
or evacuate the hostage, or anything else relevant to
your story. As long as you know what the goal is you're
golden.
• Cast
Next we've got our cast. Who's present? Which char-
acters? Which non-player characters? What does every-
one in this scene want? What is their motivation? As a
game master your job is to predict this as accurately as
possible. What do the characters you're playing want?
What would make your players happy and keep them
engaged in the story?
Be aware of everyone's motivation, and it will be
easier to juggle several characters at once. Part of the
reason I keep a cast list is so that I can see at a glance
who's head I'm supposed to be in at a glance.
• Setting
The setting should be a living and vibrant place. You
bring it to life by presenting one or more memorable
sensory details for the characters to wrap their imagi-
nation around. What does the airlock smell like? What
does a dragon screaming through the upper atmos-
phere sound like? Bring it to life for your players.
Remember that characters can only interact with
elements that you introduce. Also realize that anything
you introduce will automatically be given significance.
Back in the previous millennium, before fire, there was
a comic called Knights of the Dinner Table.
In one episode the beleaguered GM described a
Zephyr flitting through the trees. The players wasted
it with a crossbow. He mentioned a cow. They spent
hours investigating it and casting detection spells on
it. Players attention goes where you direct it.
When describing your setting mention things that
will be relevant, and mention them early. If combat is
going to break out in a bar then beforehand mention
the scrape of chair legs (weapon), the pitchers of beer
on the bar (weapon), the stairs to the second floor
(escape), the roaring fire with no screen (danger). All
that could come into play during a bar brawl, and if
you've forewarned your players they can interact with
the setting in fun believable ways.
That's really it. If you've defined a scene goal, a cast,
and a setting, then all you need is a sequence of scenes
that lead from your present location to the end of your
adventure. If you want to see that done well, then take
a look at either the First Contact or Dying World sagas.
Both are designed to show you the ropes, whether you
use them or not.

TYPES OF SCENES:
My day job is author. I've got 30 books in print, and
I've taught thousands of authors the storytelling ropes.
The rules are exactly the same for a roleplaying game
as for a novel. Scenes are divided into two basic types--
action and reaction.
Action scenes are exactly what they sound like. The
players are assaulting the starport. They're sneaking
into the Skull of Xal. They're fighting the arachnidrakes.
Reaction scenes are breathers, the thing that Michael
Bay avoids in most of his films. It's why you walk out
feeling so breathless at the end... you're never given a
chance to react.
In an RPG your reaction beats serve a vital role. This
is where roleplay happens. This is where characters
develop, and think, and plan. After they assault the
starport and escape with the loot... that's a reaction
scene. Planning the assault on the starport? Also a
reaction scene.
Varying the action of these two scenes results in
something called pacing. If your groups like fast-paced
games you'll probably see something like action,
action, reaction, action, action, reaction. If your party
likes to solve puzzles and RP more you'll probably see
reaction, action, action, reaction, action, reaction,
action.
Over time you'll develop a feel for which order to use
them in, but it helps me to track scenes as either action
or reaction when planning the scene goal.
KEEPING PLAYERS ENGAGED
So you've read the novels. You've read the setting
information, including the next chapter, and are ready
to run a game. You eagerly tell your potential players,
and get them to show up. What do you do once you have
them there, and how do you keep them engaged?
I make a practical list each session that will look
something like this:
Kaya wants to research unliving ants to create
living variant. Use her mad scientist flaw.
Daito lost a lot of credits last session, even though
he earned a luck out of it. Give him an opportunity
to earn it back somehow
Edrin hasn't quite engaged. What does he want?
Arrange an NPC encounter to ask him some ques-
tions about his background
Reaper's appearance is a definite problem as nec-
romancy is barred. How can you help him accli-
mate without penalizing his character? Give him
the tools he needs
Zoe chose to keep her cargo rather than deliver it.
How would the intended recipients react to this?
Would they send an investigator? Or use scrying
magic. There must be consequences.
Then I'll use that list to make or modify scenes
relevant to the adventure. If the party is relic hunting
aboard a Great Ship that's my setting. My scene goals
will come from the list above. My cast is determined by
player actions, and the creatures populating the ship.

PLAYER AGENCY:
The other thing we need to be aware of is player
agency. Players like to succeed, especially if they first
failed in the pursuit of the thing. Players do not like
being told, "No. That doesn't work."
I've played under many GMs during my time, and
more than a few has been a tyrant. The tyrant doesn't
respect player agency. They are running a story with
predetermined parts, and the players are there to fill
those parts, not think, or make their own decisions.
This is common referred to as railroading the players.
The best stories allow the characters choice, with
consequences. They can choose to run away. They can
start their own shipping business, or go Catalyst hop-
ping. If they do, though, then the demonic threat they
failed to contain could become a threat to the entire
sector.
I let players succeed a lot of the time. At forging
magic items. At sudden plans in combat. At creatively
using flaws. Each time we do this the player engages
more fully with the game. It becomes our story.
Together.
Give our players agency. Make them feel signifi-
cant. Tell good stories, with compelling scenes, and
your players will never leave your table. It can get
really awkward.
PLAYER SIGNIFICANCE:
All players crave significance. They want to be the
best ___________. The best pilot. Best mechanic. Most
beautiful. Smartest. Richest. Most powerful goddess.
Our job as gamemasters is to allow them to achieve
their character dreams, or some of them at least.
Letting players have everything means they will feel
not attachment to the things they receive. Give them a
bunch of powerful magic items right off the bat, and
see their engagement dwindle, and their apathy flare
when getting more loot. At the same time reward player
interests with content.
Make each character feel significant, as often as
possible. If you have a small group you might be able to
do this every session. If not, then possibly every other
session. I don't go longer than that, because if a player
goes 3 sessions with no engagement they are unlikely
to keep playing, or if they stay are probably not very
engaged in the game.
HANDLING CHARACTER DEATH
The Magitech Chronicles is a lethal system. If
you stand in the open you're going to get gunned down,
and your hit point totals are low enough that it can
happen in 2-3 spells. Smart characters are usually fine,
but every once in a while someone is going to die.
There are a few ways to handle this when it occurs.
First, I try to make sure every character has at least one
luck before going into a dangerous combat. Then they
can negate something that would kill them.
If they have no luck, and they're going to die, I see
if there's an in game way to prevent it. Recently Daito
was knocked to zero hit points, and I had a wight left
with an attack. Rather than kill him I ordered the
necromancer to have the wight stay its hand. He tried
to barter for his life.
There are times, though, when I can't save a charac-
ter. They just get pulped. When this happens I try to
have the player in question role a new character, which
keeps them occupied until I can find another insertion
point.
I encourage my players to make an RP event out of a
character death, and it rarely needs much prompting.
The risk, though, is the player who lost the character. If
you really loved that character, then they may be done
with the game.
Ask them what they want to do. Suggest a new cha-
racter they might enjoy. But also be understanding if
they want to take break. No one likes character death,
but it exists because without risk the games are not
nearly as fun.
That said, if you absolutely hate character death
lesser templates are your friend.
