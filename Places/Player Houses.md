    I didn't see anything in the book about this, so let's have a little fun with setting up your home on the mega block you live in. Regardless of background or history, you're at a point where at least you have the basics here. Presumably debt free, but not having struck major success yet in things like relic hunting or work.
    
    ## Core Concepts
    
    - Battery Days: How many full days you can power heat + basics before recharge.
    - Security Tier: 0 (flimsy), 1 (solid door), 2 (smart reinforced), 3 (heavy).
    - Attention (ATT): How much notice you draw. 0–2 quiet, 3–4 people notice, 5+ expect events.
    - Each item lists: Cost (cr), Battery Impact (days or use), ATT change.
    - Heat + Basics (net, light, cooking) consume 1 Battery Day per actual day. Special gear consumes extra “Use” days when operated.
    
    **Step 1**: Pick a Starter Battery (choose one) 1) Small Battery: 600 cr, 5 Battery Days, ATT +0 2) Medium Battery: 1100 cr, 9 Battery Days, ATT +1 3) Big Battery: 2000 cr, 16 Battery Days, ATT +2 **Step 2:** Pick Comfort (choose up to 2)
    
    - Nice Bed: 200 cr, +0 ATT (better rest)
    - Luxury Bed: 700 cr, +1 ATT (flashy)
    - Air Filter: 250 cr, −1 ATT during smog (min ATT 0), counts as “basic” (no extra drain)
    - Insulation Kit: 150 cr, +0 ATT, stretches Battery Days by +1 (flat bonus)
    
    **Step 3**: Pick Security (choose one door; add extras if desired) Doors (choose one):
    
    - Basic Door: 200 cr, Tier 1, ATT +0
    - Smart Reinforced Door: 400 cr, Tier 2, ATT +1
    - Heavy Plate Door: 800 cr, Tier 3, ATT +2
    
    Add-ons (optional):
    
    - Sensor Strip: 90 cr, ATT +0 (alerts tampering)
    - Discreet Cam: 120 cr, ATT +1 (you see them; they see your camera)
    - Safe (small): 250 cr, ATT +1
    
    **Step 4:** Pick Utility Gear (choose 0–3)
    
    - Stove (compact): 120 cr, no extra Battery drain (folded into basics), ATT +0
    - Holoscreen: 150 cr, costs ½ Battery Day every 4 actual days (ignore decimals; track when 4 days pass), ATT +1
    - Net Uplink: 70 cr, included in basics (no extra drain), ATT +0
    - Forge Mk I (refurb): 500 cr, each session consumes +1 Battery Day, ATT +2
    - Autodoc Mk I (refurb): 600 cr, each treatment consumes +1 Battery Day, ATT +1
    - Solar Patch (slow trickle): 500 cr, adds +1 Battery Day every sunny day, ATT +1
    - Scrambler (illegal): 350 cr, while active −2 ATT (floor 0), but sets base ATT to at least 3 if discovered later
    
    Quick Attention Guide
    
    - 0–2: Quiet. Rarely bothered.
    - 3–4: Occasional knocks, curious neighbors, small gang tax once in a while.
    - 5+: Expect active interest: inspectors, thieves, rivals.

3. -- Keep any credits you don't spend and use them on gear or hoard, so +3000 in addition to the base amount.
