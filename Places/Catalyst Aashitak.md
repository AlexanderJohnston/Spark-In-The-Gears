# Aashitak


As the ship drops from void into realspace, the first thing they see is not a planet but a vast, off‑white skeleton hanging alone in the dark, a half‑body the size of a small world frozen mid‑fall. The lower half of the titan is simply gone, the ragged terminus of its spine wrapped in a jagged crown of black‑gleaming void crystals that drink starlight and bleed a faint, wrong-colored radiance into the dust ring that orbits them. Around the husk drift glinting shards and slow streams of crystallized dream‑blood and ice. Ship sensors begin to register shapes, wisplike currents, shadowy predators, and bone‑lattice constructs, moving in synchronized patterns through the corpse's cavernous ribs and along the planes of its skeleton like a system-sized organism that never quite finished dying.

1 - What aspect or aspects did the deity represent?
Dream

2 - How powerful was the god?
25

3 - How did this god or goddess die?
Aashitak was slain by Nefarious and drained of blood and partially collapsed into the void. What remains is a husk of off-white bone hanging in space forming its own orbit at about half the size of a planet. The lower half of the body is missing, sealed around the wound by strange and massive void crystals. Nefarious opened a void rift and shoved half of Aashitak through it before shutting it, severing her. 

4 - What magical materials were created?

Lacuna Shards (void-seal crystals): the massive void crystals that sealed Aashitak’s wound. Black-gleaming, slightly warm to the touch, they act as rift-keys and mana reservoirs for Void/Dream spells. Can be used to stabilize or force-open small void rifts and as a high-capacity mana battery when ground and bonded into focus items. Dangerous: prolonged use frays the user’s waking mind.

Dreamglass (Somnium Crystal): droplets of crystallized dream-blood and ice that formed and orbit the husk. Translucent with a milky sheen; when socketed into magic tools it stores a single Dream spell or vision and slowly leaks prophetic fragments to those nearby. Crushed Dreamglass acts as a delayed dream-charge, used as a reagent for sleep/illusion rituals.

Nightmarrow Resin: a sticky black resin that condenses in the hollows of the husk where dream-blood pooled. Used as a sealant for dream-artifice and as a core for Nightmare traps; it imbues constructs with the ability to generate fear-based feed effects.


5 - Does the Catalyst have a Guardian?

Yes — The Half-Slumbering (also called the Somnist Wyrm in some tongues).

    Form and nature: a colossal, semi-sentient wyrm composed of Entropic Bone and living dream-matter. It coils through the husk’s orbit and between the Lacuna Shards; its ribs are splintered bone lattices threaded with Somnium Silk and vaporous dreamlight. Where the bone is broken, dream-void smoke leaks and births smaller primals.
    Role and temperament: both sentinel and priest. The Half-Slumbering enforces the husk’s domain: it lures intruders into deep, manipulable dreams and either converts them into dream-ward servitors or buries them in long sleep. It commands legions of dream-wisps, night-phantoms and bone-sentinel constructs.
    Strength: appropriate for a Divinity 25 Catalyst — a single god-guardian with near-deific primal traits and an army of lesser primals. It can manifest domain-wide dreamfields and fight like a god when roused.
    Hook: factions that wish to harvest Lacuna Shards or Entropic Bone must contend with the Half-Slumbering’s web of sleep-traps and its capacity to turn whole boarding parties into living dream-anchors.


6 - What are the dominant primal types?


    Primary: Dream-primals — wisplike somnolent spirits, phantasmal predators (Nightmares), and humanoid eidolons born of dreams. These primals are fluid, often semi-corporeal, and excel at illusion, memory-shaping and psychic attack.
    Secondary: Void-primals — rift-spectres and crepuscular shard-beasts attracted to the Lacuna Shards and the husk’s exposed void-flesh. They lend entropy, rift-manipulation and corrosion to the Catalyst’s ecosystem.
    Tertiary/associated types: Bone-constructs and husk-sentinels — animate fragments of Entropic Bone and Nightmarrow Resin that serve as guardians, miners and anchor points for ritual work. Over time, dream-primals adopt bone-masks and void-accents, becoming more fearsome and cunning.

2 - How powerful was the god?

WHAT ASPECT OR ASPECTS DID THIS DEITY REPRESENT?
All gods embody one or more aspects of magic.
The vast majority of Catalysts possess a single aspect.
Your demon god is probably void. Your legendary arti-
ficer goddess is probably life, or maybe air. You may
choose up to two adjacent aspects on the Circle of
Eight, though dual-Catalysts are very rare.
HOW POWERFUL WAS THE GOD?
Assign the god a Divinity Rating on a scale of 1 to
100. More powerful gods than that exist, and true
titans are probably 1,000 or greater, but so far as
anyone knows there are no true titans, just a lot of
shards who all believe themselves to be the heir of
the titan they came from.
DIVINITY SCALE:
• 1 = Minor god or fragment of a true god
• 5 = Lesser god or large fragment of a true god
• 10 = True god or fragment of a greater god
• 25 = Greater god or fragment of a titan
• 50 = World Devourer or large fragment of a titan
• 100 = False Titan
Divinity is used to determine powers for living gods.
For Catalysts it represents a magic pool of a specific
aspect. The greater the divinity the more people can
Catalyze, and this is very nearly exponential. A divinity
1 Catalyst might be exhausted by a thousand mages. A
rating 10 could provide magic to a million mages be-
fore dropping in rating to a 9.
The stronger the Catalyst the more contested it will
be, and the more primals it will attract.
HOW DID THIS GOD OR GODDESS DIE?
What great cosmic battle led to the death of your
goddess, or god? The legendary devourer of worlds, the
warrior scholar Xal allowed his own death. His head
was torn from his body, and became the Skull of Xal.
His body was left in a forgotten system with a dead
star, awash in his demonic children. That became the
Husk of Xal.
How did your goddess die? Is this her crown? Her
arm? Her heart? Her mind? Or her entire body?

If there is a primal it should match one of the domi-
nant primal types. The guardian's strength reflects
the strength of the Catalyst. A rating 1 might have an
earthscale drake. A rating 10 might be an elder Wyrm,
while a 25 has a god protecting it. One generally
supported by an army of primals.
Which brings us to...
WHAT MAGICAL MATERIALS WERE CREATED?
When Xal's head was ripped from his body a vast
quantity of blood sprayed forth, and crystalized in the
cold. These void stones were small enough that they
orbited the closest large structure... the Skull of Xal.
Miners willing to dare the wrath of the tech demons
can harvest these void stones.
If they make it inside, then they can harvest entropic
bone directly from the Skull itself. The bone adds a
point of armor to anything constructed with it. Void
stones can be socketed into an eldimagus to hold a
void spell, or can act as a mana battery if crushed.
What materials were created by your god's death?
Did their blood splash on mountains, infusing the iron /
gold / platinum there? Did a mighty redwood grow over
the corpse of a goddess, like Shaya? The possibilities
are only constrained by your imagination.
DOES THE CATALYST HAVE A GUARDIAN?
The universe recognizes divinity, which is why
primals are attracted to their corpses. When primals
find the corpse of a fallen deity they seek to protect it.
One will rise from among their number to become the
guardian, who is imbued with extreme power. This
could be an ancient Wyrm, or water elemental, or
anything else you can conceive of.
What would your deity's right-hand primal look
like? If there isn't one, then the Catalyst is considered
to be wild, and often times different tribes of primals
will war on each other.
WHAT ARE THE DOMINANT PRIMAL TYPES?
Primals are attracted to gods over time, and over
time their appearance can vary, as the primals begin
to effect the very deity that attracted them. Maybe in
the beginning your nature goddess attracted cosmic
wisps, air elementals with lightning powers.
Over time those wisps are captured and enslaved.
They're forced into pattern inducers, which shape
them into whatever form their new master wishes.
The wisps become more warlike over time. They
intentionally alter their appearance to look like at-
tractive young men and women, just like the slavers
turned their companions into. They infiltrate the
slavers and wipe them out.
When the wisps return some of them stay in this
new form, and a humanoid version is created.
Or, maybe you have a more traditional fantasy set
up. Maybe your guardian is a Wyrm, and you have
goblins, trolls, and ogres, all flavors of primal that
the god found pleasing in life.
