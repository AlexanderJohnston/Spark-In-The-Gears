### Opener (Recap + "right now")

---

## Read-Aloud (Primary)

**Narrator:**  
Lone Star's lights are long behind you.

You sold a war-freighter haul, made Maris disgustingly rich, synced comm bands with Black Trace, and slipped into the Umbral Depths under Kaelith's sigils, two ships running dark in the planet's shadow. Out here, Aashitak's corpse is both a landmark and a weather system. Dreamglass dust, false sensor returns, wisps that "remember" you wrong. You rode an asteroid into a dead god's mouth, parked as close as you dared, and ran.

Then the Dream caught you.

It split the team into pocket realities, jungles, loops, wrong directions, until Kaelith forced clarity with Piercing Gaze and physically ripped Asha and Lysa free, flying them through the tripwires toward the Catalyst embedded in the broken spine. Inside the nerve column, you drowned in Aashitak's last memory: gods screaming, void tearing Dream, a corpse that refuses to be only dead. You pulled back... but not unchanged.

**You catalyzed.** Dream magic took root. **Essence Sight** opened. And when you stepped back into realspace, the Guardian was waiting, wearing Aashitak's power like stolen skin and calling itself The Half-Slumbering. It tailed you like you were prey it wanted to savor. Below, Black Trace died in pieces. You grabbed Rho. You tried to save Tamsin. And the wyrm's attention kept snagging on one thing: Kaelith's Inuran spell armor and a jagged "hunger" in the flow it couldn't read.

Now, **right now**, you're at your ships, surrounded.

Kaelith: your suit hits 100% and you trigger the fully-charged function. You rocket up and **detonate into black tendrils**, a web of void-like filaments that lash out and attach to primals across hundreds of meters. Eidolons. Hounds. Wisps. Their Dreamlight screams as it's siphoned, channeled, drunk, dragged into your armor so fast the world near you loses color. Your HUD floods with a target count in the **hundreds**.

Asha: Essence Sight snaps on and the Guardian stops being a monster and becomes a circuit, Aashitak's remaining Dream rerouted through it, primals lit like bulbs on its grid. What you see is beautiful and peaceful, but wounded. The primals fear you, the Guardian too. When its gaze passes Kaelith, the flow of magic from the catalyst stutters and tears around that armor like water hitting a blade.

Then the Half-Slumbering moves.

It drops behind your corvette, plants a clawed foot on the hull, and, screaming in rage, **crushes your ship like a tin can.** Metal screams. Glass and plating fold. There is no sound in low gravity, but you can feel it in your bones if you're on the surface of the catalyst.

Above you, Kaelith, the siphoned power becomes a pressure behind your eyes and a weight in your chest: **you have a beam to fire**, something that feels made to kill gods. You already chose the only safe direction you could think of: **into the nothingness of space.**

The moment before discharge hangs like a held breath.

## Player Prompt (Immediate)

- **Kaelith:** The beam is about to go. What does "firing it into space" look like, tight, controlled lance; wide, venting spray; sustained burn or a single pulse? And what do you do to keep the suit from pulling more than you can bleed off?
- **Asha:** Your ship is collapsing under a god's foot. Where are you in relation to it **this second**, and what do you do to avoid getting pinned, shredded, or thrown when the beam hits and the Dreamfield reacts?
- **Lysa / Rho / Tamsin (as applicable):** You're in the kill-zone with primals converging and the Guardian's attention fully locked. Who are you grabbing, who are you leaving, and what's your exit plan now that the corvette is scrap?

## Mechanics Cue (Fast, usable)

- **Everybody:** Roll **Intuition + Skepticism (DT3)** to keep your mind from sliding under the Dream pressure spike as Kaelith vents god-grade energy.  
  - **Fail:** You lose your next action to disorientation / intrusive visions.  
  - **Pass:** You act normally and can spot one immediate "safe line" (a momentary gap in primal attention, or cover that isn't a lie).

**Narrator:** The void-tendrils tighten. The Guardian's stolen Dream surges in protest. And Kaelith's armor, hungry, brilliant, wrong, begins to speak in the only language it has left.

**What do you do?**


### What the logs tell us (behavioral “anchors”)

- **Rho Anselm** (Session 3): calm, captain-to-captain transactional; probes terms (“who touches the Catalyst,” salvage rights), keeps the room controlled, assumes responsibility. (Session 4): goes first, stays composed in the sprint, fights to the last, survives badly hurt.  
- **Lysa Vorren** (Session 3): Catalyst-hungry, poetic about magic, quickly “locks onto” Kaelith’s vibe; professional mage with addiction/obsession undertone. (Session 4): wards the group, gets dream-caught, then becomes almost worshipful (“Did you see her?”), tries to *appeal* to the Guardian—she believes in sentience/divine “choice.”  
- **Tamsin “Longstep” Vale** (Session 3): laconic, survivalist (“aim for old and boring”), quiet competence. (Session 4): holds the ridge, retreats under pressure, blunt about casualties (“Mudcat’s fucking dead”), keeps moving.  
- **Mudcat Harrow** (Session 3): loud grease-wizard comic relief with a practical edge. (Session 4): the pragmatic atmos/radiation warning… then radio silence; Tamsin confirms death.  
- **Asha + Kaelith dynamics** matter: they’re the decision center; Kaelith’s armor becomes a *plot-gravity object* (Essence Sight shows it “drinks a different kind of power”), and Kaelith just used a God-killing siphon that triggered the Guardian to crush Asha’s ship.

### Immediate emotional reactions once they’re back aboard Rho’s ship (first 30–90 minutes)

#### Rho: “Captain mode” first, then delayed grief
- **Front-facing behavior**: triage, headcount, seal compartments, hard-status the ship, comm discipline. He’ll keep his voice flat and procedural because that’s how he survives shock.
- **Private cracks** (later): a quiet, ugly moment alone—either staring at an empty roster entry for Mudcat / the company, or physically shaking while he rewraps an injury. He’ll feel **responsible** because he led point and sold them on “we’re always ready.”
- **How he treats Asha/Kaelith**: grateful they *extracted* survivors, but also newly wary: Kaelith’s armor/beam escalated the entire threat profile. Rho will want a debrief with the tone of a commander, not a buddy.

#### Tamsin: adrenaline hangover → anger → numb care-taking
- **First beat**: she gets her helmet off, finds somewhere to sit on the floor, and just breathes. She’ll **shake** once she’s safe enough to let it happen.
- **Second beat**: anger that’s almost clinical—short sentences, sharp edges. Not melodrama; more like “Who made the call that got my people killed?” She’s not looking to mutiny, but she *will* demand a coherent story.
- **Mudcat grief**: this will land as a **small, brutal ritual**—she’ll pocket something of his if anyone brought it back; if not, she’ll quietly rage at the unfairness (“he deserved a hangar funeral, not the god’s teeth”). Expect a *single* line that hits harder than a speech.

#### Lysa: euphoric reverence + terror + fixation (Catalyst afterglow)
- **Afterglow behavior**: she’s changed. She’ll talk too fast for 2 minutes, then go very still. She may compulsively re-engage **Essence Sight** even though it’s overwhelming, like checking a wound.
- **Cognitive dissonance**: she believed “Aashitak chose us,” then the Guardian claims “I am Aashitak” while acting like a hostile usurper. Lysa will try to **rationalize** it (guardian-as-parasite, guardian-as-child, guardian-as-mask).
- **Fixation on Kaelith**: she’s the first to connect that his armor *matters* metaphysically. She’ll oscillate between awe (“that suit is impossible”) and fear (“that suit is bait”). She may insist the armor be **isolated / warded / studied** immediately.

### The “relax one degree” scenes that will feel true to what you’ve written

#### 1) The silent headcount
- Rho reads names. No one interrupts. Tamsin’s jaw clenches on Mudcat. Lysa doesn’t look up.  
- End with Rho: “We are not doing a second run. We are leaving. Then we decide what we are.”

#### 2) The Mudcat-shaped hole
- Someone reaches for a tool/duct tape joke and stops mid-sentence.  
- Tamsin: “Don’t.” (Not angry—just final.)

#### 3) The debrief that becomes a blame grenade (but doesn’t explode yet)
Key fault-lines to press gently:
- **Asha**: her ship is destroyed; she’s furious/heartbroken but trained to compartmentalize.  
- **Rho**: his company is dead; his identity is “I bring people home,” and he failed.  
- **Kaelith**: he *saved* them, but also triggered the Guardian’s spike reaction.  
- **Lysa**: she got what she wanted (Dream) and it cost everyone else.

A realistic outcome is **contained conflict**: Rho forbids infighting until they’re out of the shadow; Tamsin agrees because she’s disciplined; Lysa doesn’t because she’s not really “here” yet.

#### 4) The first real panic: “it’s still in us”
Once they’re safe, someone realizes the Catalyst isn’t just a power-up—it's a **hook in the psyche**.
- Lysa quietly asks if anyone else feels the pull to “drink deeper.”  
- Asha admits it felt *good*.  
- Tamsin doesn’t feel it the same way and that scares her more.  
- Rho hears this and immediately treats it like contamination: sleep rotations, buddy checks, no one alone.

### Longer-tail shifts (next day, once shock settles)

- **Rho** becomes more controlling: he’ll insist on written rules around Kaelith’s armor/beam use, and he’ll push for a concrete plan to avoid ever being inside a Guardian’s engagement envelope again.
- **Tamsin** becomes Asha’s harsh mirror: she respects competence, but she’ll be blunt that *romantic Catalyst talk gets people killed*. She may still choose to stay—out of loyalty to Rho and because she’s already committed.
- **Lysa** becomes mission-dangerous in a different way: not reckless exactly—**compelled**. She’ll advocate returning “when prepared,” justify it morally (“Aashitak chose us for a reason”), and privately fear withdrawal from that Dream clarity.
- **Group cohesion** will hinge on a shared story they can live with:
  - “We didn’t win; we survived. The Catalyst marked us. The Guardian is a thief. Mudcat and the company bought our lives with theirs. We don’t waste that.”

If you want, I can draft a short onboard scene (1–2 pages) in the same voice as your logs, with dialogue that cleanly sets up the next session’s emotional landscape and the new stakes around Kaelith’s armor.
