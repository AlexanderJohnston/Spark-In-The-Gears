Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Evening all



Wartok:OOC - hey, hey

Asha Morrow:OOC howdy



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: I had time to get pretty much all the opening stuff prepped so I'll dive right in if we're ready



Narrator:Lone Star's lights are long behind you.

You sold a war-freighter haul, made Maris disgustingly rich, synced comm bands with Black Trace, and slipped into the Umbral Depths under Kaelith's sigils, two ships running dark in the planet's shadow. Out here, Aashitak's corpse is both a landmark and a weather system. Dreamglass dust, false sensor returns, wisps that "remember" you wrong. You rode an asteroid into a dead god's mouth, parked as close as you dared, and ran.

Then the Dream caught you.

It split the team into pocket realities, jungles, loops, wrong directions, until Kaelith forced clarity with Piercing Gaze and physically ripped Asha and Lysa free, flying them through the tripwires toward the Catalyst embedded in the broken spine. Inside the nerve column, you drowned in Aashitak's last memory: gods screaming, void tearing Dream, a corpse that refuses to be only dead. You pulled back... but not unchanged.

**You catalyzed.** Dream magic took root. **Essence Sight** opened. And when you stepped back into realspace, the Guardian was waiting, wearing Aashitak's power like stolen skin and calling itself The Half-Slumbering. It tailed you like you were prey it wanted to savor. Below, Black Trace died in pieces. You grabbed Rho. You tried to save Tamsin. And the wyrm's attention kept snagging on one thing: Kaelith's Inuran spell armor and a jagged "hunger" in the flow it couldn't read.

Now, **right now**, you're at your ships, surrounded.



Narrator:Kaelith: your suit hits 100% and you trigger the fully-charged function. You rocket up and **detonate into black tendrils**, a web of void-like filaments that lash out and attach to primals across hundreds of meters. Eidolons. Hounds. Wisps. Their Dreamlight screams as it's siphoned, channeled, drunk, dragged into your armor so fast the world near you loses color. Your HUD floods with a target count in the **hundreds**.

Asha: Essence Sight snaps on and the Guardian stops being a monster and becomes a circuit, Aashitak's remaining Dream rerouted through it, primals lit like bulbs on its grid. What you see is beautiful and peaceful, but wounded. The primals fear you, the Guardian too. When its gaze passes Kaelith, the flow of magic from the catalyst stutters and tears around that armor like water hitting a blade.

Then the Half-Slumbering moves.

It drops behind your corvette, plants a clawed foot on the hull, and, screaming in rage, **crushes your ship like a tin can.** Metal screams. Glass and plating fold. There is no sound in low gravity, but you can feel it in your bones if you're on the surface of the catalyst.

Above you, Kaelith, the siphoned power becomes a pressure behind your eyes and a weight in your chest: **you have a beam to fire**, something that feels made to kill gods. You already chose the only safe direction you could think of: **into the nothingness of space.**

The moment before discharge hangs like a held breath.

Narrator: Kaelith:The beam is about to go. What does "firing it into space" look like, tight, controlled lance; wide, venting spray; sustained burn or a single pulse? And what do you do to keep the suit from pulling more than you can bleed off?

Narrator: Asha:Your ship is collapsing under a god's foot. Where are you in relation to it **this second**, and what do you do to avoid getting pinned, shredded, or thrown when the beam hits and the Dreamfield reacts?

Asha Morrow:Asha had been running to her ship when the Guardian crushes it like nothing. She doesn't have time to understand what's happening, she veers off away from her now fucked ship towards any cover she can find. Anything to protect her from whatever the next moment might bring.



Narrator:Asha finds cover, diving behind the cover of an outcropping covering her from the ship and the forming energy of Kaelith overhead.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa lifts off hard, shaking out the last of that empty-eyed stare, and snaps her rifle up. "Rho, on me. Tamsin, break right and run to my voice." She angles for the nearest dip in the godflesh that still looks real, eyes flicking up at Kaelith's rising silhouette.

Rho Anselm:Rho spits blood into his mask, shoulders his weapon, and forces his bad leg to take weight. "Copy, I'm moving, and I'm not dying here." He turns his head just enough to clock Asha taking cover and the collapsing corvette, then starts cutting toward Lysa's line.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Tamsin backpedals two steps, plants, and dumps a burst into the closest shape pushing through the dust. "I'm coming, just keep that lane open!" She pivots and sprints toward Lysa, keeping her barrel low and her breathing loud in comms.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will unleash a slowly widening cone, gradually expanding as it rushes forward into the emptiness above. It is one long solid blast. Kaelith monitors the power consumption and once the suits drain reaches a sustainable level he attempts to cut power to the systems firing the beam_



Narrator:The Half-Slumbering shifts its weight on the wrecked corvette and lifts its skull just enough to watch Kaelith. The stolen Dream in its body ripples and tightens, and every primal within view seems to lean toward Kaelith at once, like a hundred heads turning to the same scream.

Narrator: Kaelith:This message has been hidden.

The beam is there, ready. You can feel it building in your chest and behind your eyes, and the suit keeps trying to drink more as a cone of energy erupts from your armor into the void of space.

Narrator:Kaelith opens the beam like a gate. It starts as a tight, black-white core, then widens into a slowly expanding cone that pours upward into the emptiness above Aashitak's jaw. The light isn't light, it's absence shaped into a weapon, and as it blooms it drinks the color out of the sky around it, a long solid blast that does not flicker.

Kaelith watches the readout like a pilot watches a failing engine. The suit keeps trying to pull more, hungry and blind, but he rides the edge of it until the drain hits something sustainable, then he reaches into the interface and cuts power to the firing system.

The beam collapses in on itself with a hard snap, like a throat closing.

Narrator: Asha:She hears that snap and her mind decides it is something else. The outcropping behind her becomes a wall in a jungle, wet leaves slapping her visor, insects hammering her armor, a stream at her feet flowing the wrong direction. Her hands claw at bone that feels like bark, and for a second she can't remember why she is hiding, only that she must.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa's lift stutters. Mid-flight, her body jerks like the Dream has grabbed her by the spine, and the world around her turns too bright and too close. She sees Aashitak's nerve forest again and the Guardian's eye looking in at her like a lantern, and her rifle swings wide on instinct, muzzle tracking a threat that isn't there.

Tamsin Vale:Tamsin's sprint turns into a stumble-step, then another. She hears voices in her comms that aren't comms, a chorus of her own shots coming back at her from different angles, and for an awful moment the ground feels like it is tilting sideways into a drop that doesn't exist.

Rho Anselm:Rho does not hesitate.

He drops into the scar-cut depression and runs it like a trench, half limping, half sprinting, using the bone ridge to keep the worst sightlines off him. "Tamsin! Eyes on me!" he barks, voice raw, and then he is on her.

Tamsin is moving, but it is wrong. Her feet keep going while her head keeps searching a battlefield that is not here, and her rifle keeps trying to solve a problem the Dream is whispering into her hands.

Rho grabs her by the harness at the back of her armor and yanks hard, not gentle. "Snap out of it!" He slams her down into the depression, puts his body between her and the open plain, and keys his mic. "Kaelith, I have her. Cover me, now."

Asha Morrow:Asha is disoriented and stumbles around to find a better hiding place to be hidden from any predators in this jungle.

The Half-Slumberling:The Guardian stays perched over the wreck like it owns the ground, one claw still pinning what is left of your corvette, the other flexing slowly as if testing whether it wants to tear the rest apart. Its skull lifts and turns with deliberate precision, tracking movement by "feel" more than sight, following the tug of minds and Dream through the jaw like a predator tasting blood in water.

Narrator:Asha, you feel a voice within you telling you to _see_ through it.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks around, focusing her eyes and reflexively activating Essence Sight once more.

Narrator: Asha:With Essence Sight active, you see the dream clouding and clinging to your face. It can be easily moved away with your ability to push and manipulate dream magic, now that you know what and where it is.

It's a bit like trying to see through a heavy pink haze.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith turns his attention to Rho and covering his retreat. Cueing up the HUD he begins searching for targets while keeping a glancing eye on the guardian_

Narrator: Kaelith:Kaelith, you're tracking two hounds making a mad dash for them now, if you can take them out before they arrive.

Asha Morrow:Asha _pushes_ on the dream magic to get it away from her and see what's really happening.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Kaelith, did you smack a spell pistol onto your shoulder mount? I forgot.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will take aim and fire at the hounds_

Narrator: Asha:Asha is immediately thrust from the illusion and back into the real world, a little disoriented still but rapidly regaining context.

She can see that Lysa is flying... wrong. Likely trapped. Rho and Tamsin are yelling in their mics, and Kaelith is covering them apparently.

Rho sounds calm despite his tone of voice. He sounds like he has Tamsin.

Asha Morrow:Asha will try to clear any dream around Lysa so she can regain control.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Yes, found it, you snapped it in Session 1 Kaelith

OOC: +2 to your base damage on your attacks.

Narrator:The first hound is killed in a single shot by Kaelith's void bolt carving a hole right through it, followed by a void bolt from the mount on his shoulder.

The second hound is clipped and it rolls, crashing into the dusty bones of Aashitak. It is only injured, but it's recovering when suddenly Kaelith's shoulder mounted pistol unleashes a sleep bolt instead. The hound goes unconscious.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Asha, have you chosen an expression stat for spellcasting yet?

Asha Morrow:OOC I guess charisma



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - Void does double damage to Dream. Just read the spell



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Oh beautiful, I did not know that

OOC - Thanks for the heads up.

OOC - Where'd you see the double damage?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I didn't realize either

OOC - in the void bolt spell description



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Okay for Asha, use Charisma + Spellcasting roll to see what you get to clear Lysa. DT 1.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa snaps out of it as Asha shoves the illusion away from her. "Wow, this place is incredible. I'm back! Covering fire!" She turns in the air and helps Kaelith sink shots into the primals making their way to tear apart Rho and Tamsin.

Rho Anselm:Rho meanwhile has pulled Tamsin up and they are both running. She's snapped out of it and they're all making a beeline for the ship, passing right under Lysa and past Asha.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks back towards what remains of her ship, sizing up the Guardian. She needs to get in her ship and see if she can pull out the other spell armor and even the stealth coating if she's lucky.

The Half-Slumberling:It stays perched at the wreck like it's studying an unfamiliar tool, head tilted, attention fixed on Kaelith's armor with something that reads less like rage and more like fascination. Its voice comes calmer, almost conversational, carried through the bone and the Dream at the same time: "That thing on yoi. Where did you find it?"

It seems to have forgotten the other humans below except for Kaelith.

In its fascination it begins to lift from the ground and into the air, taking flight to circle around the area slowly.



Narrator:Asha, your ship is a wreck. It will take a DT3 Athletics checks to get into it and pull out the gear you need.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Still monitoring the situation with his allies and their defense, Kaelith floats slowly towards the Guardian_ "I came upon it while raiding a stranded warship."

Asha Morrow:_Greed_ hits Asha like a ship ramming into her, she hits a dead sprint towards her ship while the chance is here with full intentions of grabbing her stuff and moving it to Rho's ship.

Narrator:Asha is able to find the cargo hold, what is left of it, but a way in seems impossible. She begins prying at the metal hull where there is a gap, straining and failing. Sweat drips down her face beneath the armor's visor.

Does she continue?

Asha Morrow:Of course

Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I cannot say who the ship belonged to or where it's original destination was, but it was of Inuran design."

Asha Morrow:Asha goes in, big push time.

Rho Anselm:Before Asha can touch it, the hull cracks open.

Rho bowls it down like a tank and crashes inside, stumbling into what is left of the cargo hold.



Narrator:What you want to find is intact, grab and go at your leisure.

Asha Morrow:Asha follows him and looks around frantically, suddenly grabbing the spell armor and stealth coating when she sees they're still there. "Come on, you good? Let's get the fuck out of here!"

The Half-Slumberling:"The Inurans... this is from the old war then. Heed my warning now, destroy it. And destroy the ship it came from."

"What you wear is an affront to life itself."

Rho Anselm:"Second that, let's get the _fuck_ out!"



Narrator:Tamsin and Lysa are running up the boarding ramp into the Black Trace's ship. Tamsin stops at the top and crouches, holding cover for the rest.

Rho Anselm:Rho sprints for his ship and reaches the ramp, calling over the mic. "Kaelith, get your ass down here. NOW!"

Asha Morrow:Asha puts 100% of herself in getting to Rho's ship with the goods.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith hovers in the air. now fixated on the Guardian_ "Yes, an old war. But what do that mean? An affront to life itself?"

The Half-Slumberling:"Nefarious is an ancient threat to ever being in this universe. Seek your archives. I am no librarian and the fact your people have already forgotten is sickening."

"LEAVE this catalyst and never return here. If you do, I will destroy you. I will not warn you."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith nods to the Guardian, then turns and burns for Rho ship_



Narrator:The boarding ramp slams up and the seal takes with a heavy clunk that you feel through your boots.

For the first time in minutes, the sound in your helmets is mostly your own breathing and the ship's fans. It smells like hot metal, old gun oil, and blood in a filter. The corridor lights are down in red, emergency low. Rho's ship shudders once, not an impact so much as the godflesh outside remembering you exist.

Behind you, the ramp motor whines as it locks. Somewhere in the hull, something ticks like a cooling barrel. The air inside is thin but real. It has edges. It feels like shelter.

It is not safe yet.

Rho Anselm:Rho limps in hard, one hand on the wall, the other on his weapon. His mask is fogged with his own breath. He does not look at the empty spaces where his people should be.

Tamsin Vale:She drops to a knee just inside the ramp, barrel aimed at the seam, pure muscle memory, holding the door against a thing that can crush ships with a foot.

Lysa Vorren:Lys hovers for half a second, then forces herself down onto the deck like gravity is something she has to remember to respect. Her eyes are too bright behind her visor. She keeps swallowing like she can taste the Catalyst still, and she can't seem to sit still.

Asha Morrow:Asha finds a corner to stash her goods and pulls out her shotgun in case of a surprise while heading towards the bridge, "Come on Rho!"

Narrator: Kaelith:Kaelith, your suit is quiet for the first time since it hit 100%, but not calm. It is like a dog that has tasted blood and is now staring at the door.

The Half-Slumbering's words are still fresh: "Nefarious." "Destroy it." "Affront to life itself."

You can feel the ship around you, ward lines, wiring, metal, and under it all the faint pull of the Catalyst like a tide that does not care you left.

Narrator: Asha:Asha, the moment you are inside, your hands feel empty. Your ship is gone. How you feel about that might not come up yet.

Rho Anselm:Rho stumbles two steps deeper into the corridor, then forces his bad leg to take weight like it owes him money. He drags his mask off just long enough to spit blood onto the deck and get a real breath, then slaps it back on.

"Copy. Move."

He keys the intercom, voice clipped and ugly, captain voice, not comfort voice. "Bridge, this is Rho... Right. No bridge crew. Just us."

He catches himself mid-stride like the words cost him. His jaw tightens once, then he shoves it down where it belongs for ten more minutes.

Rho thumbs his comm and keeps moving, limping toward the cockpit himself. "All stations, listen up. Asha is flying. Tamsin, you stay on that ramp seam until we're clear. Lysa, wards on the inner bulkheads and over the ramp housing. I want a hard line between this ship and the Dream. Kaelith, you are the Secondary behind Lysa in case we need to go offensive."

OOC: Note, Secondary means you basically hang out on the bridge to swap in and out of the matrix as needed

Asha Morrow:Asha rushes to the bridge, acknowledging Rho "On it." she finds the pilot seat and starts pre-flight while fighting the urge to rush through this and get the fuck out.



Wartok:_Kaelith stands just inside the ramp staring at it like he can see through it, watching the world outside. The guardians words repeat through his thoughts as he stares. Rho's words finally cracking the daydream, he turns and breaks for the bridge._

Lysa Vorren:"On it." Lysa sprints for the bridge and plants her boots at the base of the spell matrix. She lifts a hand, ready to cast through the sigils. "If the Dream tries to bleed in, it'll have to chew through my magic first." She swallows, eyes unfocusing for a second like she's seeing the nerve forest again. "Rho, don't wait. Every second we sit here it learns us better."

Tamsin Vale:"Copy." Tamsin stays crouched by the ramp housing, rifle aimed at the seam, breathing loud in comms.



(To Wartok): +1 Favor die

Asha Morrow:Assuming pre-flight goes without a hitch Asha will begin liftoff as soon as they are ready to go.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith finally reaching the bridge after a few minutes of making wrong turns, takes up place along side Lysa prepared to assume her role if needed._



Narrator:Asha brings the ship up on minimal thrust, just enough to peel free of the Catalyst without advertising it, and the deck vibrates under your boots as the hull reluctantly becomes a ship again. Tamsin stays planted at the ramp housing until the last shudder, then she backs off and moves fast down the corridor, weapon up, finding a strap point without taking her eyes off the red-lit angles.

Lysa braces at the spell matrix and lays her wards like a tight net of spirit runes which spread across the outer bulkheads and the seams of the ship, lips moving under her breath as if she is arguing with herself. Rho forces his bad leg through the cockpit and calls headings while Asha flies, and on the forward display the nav overlay draws the long, tapering cone of shadow the planet swallows from the system's star.

Kaelith takes the Secondary at the matrix, suit humming, and as the ship knifes toward that umbral shadow and drops its lights and signature as low as it can, everyone does the same thing at once: they get ready to crack reality and leave before the Half-Slumbering remembers to reach for them again.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Going to transit us to just inside the Umbral Depths now, bit of a scene skip so we don't have to do all the "I roll to open void hole"

The stars outside smear and then go wrong as the ship slips into the Umbral Depths, drives low, lights down, weapons cold. The sound is mostly the ship now, a steady hum that feels like a lid closing over a screaming pot, and for the first time since Aashitak you have enough quiet to notice what your body has been doing this whole time.

There are only four of you on a ship meant for more.

Rho Anselm:Rho is at the command console, staring at the nav screen because there is no one else to do it, one hand on the board, the other clenched hard enough that his knuckles keep whitening and then reddening. He runs a checklist out loud like a prayer, not because the ship needs it, but because his brain does. Every few seconds his eyes flick to the empty comm panel like he expects a voice to come back, and when it does not, his jaw tightens once and he keeps going. When the ship settles into the Depths, his shoulders finally drop a fraction, and it looks less like relief and more like something in him giving up on pretending it can fix what just happened.

Tamsin Vale:Tamsin stays near the ramp housing at first out of habit, rifle across her knees, helmet still on for longer than it needs to be. Once the Umbral takes, she finally pulls it off, sits with her back against the bulkhead, and just breathes through the shaking that hits the moment she lets it.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa is at the spell matrix even though she does not have to be, fingers resting on the sigils like she is afraid to let go of the only thing that felt certain in the last hour. She toggles Essence Sight on and off in short bursts, compulsive, like picking at a scab, then winces every time the Dream flow sharpens and she can "taste" Aashitak again. Her mouth keeps moving as if she is rehearsing an explanation to someone who is not here, and her eyes are too bright with equal parts awe and fear. The worst part is that a piece of her looks happy, and she hates that part enough that she keeps warding harder, as if discipline can erase desire.

Asha Morrow:Asha leans back and rips off her helmet, "**Fuck!**" she yells at nothing in particular, she looks around the bridge at everyone there then back to looking forward, feeling lost. "This sucks." Her mind flashes to her room on her ship, now left behind to rot on that catalyst. Pictures. Trinkets. Things that reminded her of people long gone, now also gone just the same. Asha struggles with a wave of grief, as if feeling their deaths a second time.

Rho Anselm:Rho keeps his eyes on the board, but his hand stops moving for a beat like the words hit him in the spine. "Yeah," he says quietly, then swallows, voice going flat on purpose. "It sucks."

He reaches over, taps the intercom, and it makes a soft tone that used to mean "company, listen up." He stares at it like it is a loaded gun. "Black Trace. Status check." His voice is steady. The silence that answers is not.

Rho exhales through his nose, long and controlled, then keys it again anyway. "Mudcat." He waits. His jaw works once. "Tamsin. Lysa. Rho. Report." He releases the button and his fingers tremble just enough that he curls them into a fist to hide it.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa is standing too close to the spell matrix, helmet still on, palm pressed to the sigils like she is feeling a pulse through metal. "Aashitak chose," she murmurs, not quite into comms and not quite to anyone in the room, voice thin with wonder and sickness. "She chose."

Tamsin Vale:"Tamsin, green," she reports flatly over comms, not fully able to hide that her voice is shaking.



(To Asha Morrow): +1 favor die



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith stumbles back a few steps from his perch next to the matrix and plops onto his ass right there on the bridge floor. He rips his helmet from his head and lets it fall to the floor along side him. He glances around at the remainder of the mission force then his head sinks into his hands and he exhales long, slow, and deep._

Narrator: Kaelith:As you exhale, Kaelith, you feel your suit breathing with you. Not physically, but magic flows through it. It sips now, content, happy. _Pleased_, the word bubbles through your mind from somewhere else.

Asha Morrow:Asha runs her fingers through her hair staring out as if looking for something that isn't there. "I cannot fucking believe we are alive. Why did it let us leave?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith struggles to his feet and begins looking over the suit as if inspecting it's very creation_ "What the fuck is this thing?" _He says out loud, but to himself in reality_

Lysa Vorren:Lysa turns so fast it looks like the Dream yanked her by the chin. Her visor locks on Kaelith where he sits on the deck, helmet off, hands in his hair, and for a second she just stares like she is seeing Kaelith for the first time.

Lysa drifts closer, not fast, not careful in the normal way, careful like a scientist is careful around a volatile reagent. Her eyes stay on Kaelith's bare face and the way the magic around him refuses to settle, and she speaks like she's picking up the same conversation from the bar, only now the stakes are written in corpses.

"Back at Lone Star you talked about Dream like it was a key and Void like it was language. You said imbalance is just someone being afraid of what they don't understand." She glances up at the ceiling as if she can see the Umbral through it. "Well, we just walked inside a sentence the universe wrote before we existed, and it wrote back in your handwriting."

She crouches, close enough that her voice is quiet and intense. "So talk to me, Kaelith. Theory. What did you find in there?" She stands with him as he does.

Her gaze follows his down to the helmet, curiously. "That?"

Rho Anselm:Rho doesn't look away from the board for a second, hands working the ship like routine can keep the universe from noticing them again. "It didn't let us leave," he says, voice flat, tired, honest.

"It warned Kaelith. It talked. It watched. That's not mercy, Asha. That's a predator deciding you aren't worth the bite yet, or that it likes the way you run."

He swallows, jaw tightening once. "Or it couldn't finish it, for some reason. Doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is we got out, and we do not give it another chance to change its mind."

Asha Morrow:Asha's face contorts as she turns to Rho, "Man that sounds like it let us leave. You're right, it doesn't matter, but I don't feel like any of us should be alive right now that was **so** much worse than I thought it would be and my expectation was low."

Rho Anselm:Rho lets out a short breath through his nose, not a laugh, not quite a sigh. He keeps watching the nav route through the depths, but his eyes flick to her for half a second, enough to see the look on her face and file it away.

"Yeah," he says. "Your expectation was low and reality still found a way to go under it."

His voice stays even, but it has edges now. "You want the part that will keep you sane? I don't try to make it fair. Catalysts don't kill you because you deserve it. Guardians don't spare you because you're special. Sometimes the math just lands the way it lands."

He taps a control, then adds, quieter, "We're alive because Kaelith dragged people out of the Dream and because we ran like cowards at exactly the right time. Call it luck, call it skill, call it theft. But don't romanticize it. That's how you get back home."

His gaze hardens, then softens, and he leans back to stare up at the scry screen showing the void outside their ship. "When we were boarding I wanted so badly to be angry with you two, but I'm not. Nobody would have made it out of there without you two. I guess, what I'm saying, is the only person I blame is myself."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith slowly looks up at Lysa_ "I..I..I can't verbalize what I learned just yet Lysa. The amount of raw magical reality we just consumed is pulsing through my brain so fast that I can't slow it down enough to make sense of it. But what I can tell you is that Dream is still the key. Dream, through fire gives us the path to follow. And still, void is the instruction manual. But what I don't yet understand is why or how or even what it means that we were chosen. Why would a God choose us?"

Lysa Vorren:Lysa listens without blinking, like if she looks away the thought will evaporate. When he says "chosen" her throat works once, a swallow that does not go down clean.

Asha Morrow:Asha finds a way to lean back farther, maybe turning herself to lean back against the armrest and stair at the ceiling, "You can blame us if you want, I don't mind. I should have known better. I feel like i should have anyways. It was one thing for the catalyst to be there, that already felt like winning a huge gamble. Right when it feels too good, too lucky, that's when I should know better and I didn't this time. A lot of people died for that."

Asha cranes her neck to try and look over at Rho, "I lost my ship, my entire _life_ was on that ship and has been my life for awhile now. But I didn't lose _people_, you have a right to be angry."

Lysa Vorren:"Because we are her children," she says, voice low, steadier now that she has a shape to hold onto. "Not metaphor. Not 'inspired by.' In that memory, she looked down at you and Asha like you belonged to her. Like she recognized you."

She shifts her weight, eyes flicking to the matrix and back to Kaelith's face. "Dream shows paths because it remembers every version of the world that could exist. But what we touched in the spine was older than paths. It was origin. It was the part where a god decides what a 'child' even is."

She leans in a fraction, not smiling. "So why would a god choose you? Because she already did, a long time ago, and we just walked into the place where that choice was written. Or because whatever is left of her is still defending her secrets, and children are the only hands she trusts to carry them."

Rho Anselm:"I'm not blaming you," he says, voice quiet but firm. "If I want someone to blame, I start with myself. I took a contract and I brought a company. I heard 'Catalyst' and I still said yes. That's on me."

He exhales, jaw tightening once. "A ship is not just a ship. It's our life. Without it, we don't belong anywhere. It's no different than family. I'm sorry, Asha."

Then, a beat later, uglier underneath the control. "And if I'm angry, it's not at you. It's at the way that place makes it feel good. The way it tempts you into thinking luck is the same thing as permission."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"She seems to have given you some clarity Lysa. This is good. Perhaps once my mind clears then i too shall see with better vision. I can't get the Guardian's words from my mind. And when I look at this armor now I see only destruction. For a few brief moments I was not sure that I could maintain control of the armor. I thought it may kill everything in sight."

Asha Morrow:Asha tilts her head at that, mulling over her own thoughts on luck and the mistake she repeats in relying on it. She uprights herself in her seat, looking straight over at Rho now, "You're a good man. I'm sorry what this cost you."

Tamsin Vale:Tamsin stays posted near the ramp housing longer than she needs to, rifle across her knees, because "watch the door" is a problem she can solve and everything else isn't. When the ship settles into the Umbral and the vibration smooths out, she finally pulls her helmet off, sets it beside her with careful hands, and the shaking hits her in short, involuntary bursts like her body is trying to catch up to what her mind refused to feel on the run.

She checks her mag, re-seats it, checks it again, then stares at the rounds like they are supposed to add up to Mudcat. Her breathing goes loud once, and she presses the heel of her hand into her eye socket hard enough to hurt, then stops, then does it again.

She lets out a primal yell of anger and frustration, kept to herself at this end of the ship with at least a bulkhead or two between her and the bridge. With that, Tamsin scoops her helmet and carries her rifle back to the bridge. She returns looking as flat as humanly possible. Devoid of response to the situation, simply standing at attention on the bridge.

Rho Anselm:His expression tightens at Asha's words like he's deciding whether to let them land. Rho finally glances over at Asha, finally softening. "Don't," he says quietly. Not harsh, just firm. "I'm not interested in hearing either of us apologize for surviving. And thank you, you're a fine captain yourself."

He glances over as Tamsin returns to the bridge, eyes flicking to her like he's checking a firing lane. His mouth twitches, almost nothing, the reflex of a man trying to be a captain instead of a witness.

"Longstep," he says, and his mouth almost finds a smile. "I was about to ask why the duct tape was missing."

Tamsin Vale:"Don't." She says. Her tone is deadly.

Rho Anselm:"Sorry," he adds, softer. Not an apology that fixes anything, just a human admission.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa's eyes flick to the armor plates as if she can see the moment the tendrils went out, then back to Kaelith's face. She nods once, slow.

"Yeah," she says quietly. "Clarity is a kind word for it. I think I just ran out of places to lie to myself."

She lowers her voice further, practical now. "If it tried to take your hands, that's not just power. That's appetite. The fact you noticed it, the fact you were afraid of it, that might be the only reason we're still having this conversation."

Asha Morrow:Asha looks around and settles back in her seat, feeling out of place like a surprise guest in someone's home. She glances over at Kaelith and Lysa, having been too caught up in her own conversation to keep up with theirs.



Narrator:The ship is steady in the Umbral Depths now, running dark, and the bridge feels too small for four people and too large for what it used to hold.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith rests his head in his hands briefly before slowly running his fingers through his long silver-white hair_ "I have no idea who this suit was made for or why, but if I am to continue wearing it, I must become it's master and not it's servant. I will not be made a slave to the desire for death this armor portrays."

Rho Anselm:Rho clears his throat and forces his voice into captain-shape. "All right. We are stable. We are not dead. That is the only win we get right now. "Lysa, keep your wards up until we leave the Depths, and don't forget to drink water. I am going to tape myself back together in medical."

Lysa Vorren shoots Captain a nod.

Rho Anselm:Rho leaves for medical.

Tamsin Vale:Tamsin stands awkwardly for a minute and then excuses herself. "Food."

Asha Morrow:Asha watches Rho leave, and resists the urge to follow Tamsin for food, instead opting to walk over to Kaelith. Ignoring Lysa she leans down towards Kaelith, "You good? That seemed like a lot out there."

Lysa Vorren:Lysa pauses, watching Kaelith's fingers run through his hair. She stares a little too long, then glances off to the side, then to Asha. She stays quiet and studies the two of them.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I have much to work through in my mind, but I am good. Or will be at least. What matters at this moment is that the 5 of us get somewhere safe to lay low and lick our wounds."

Asha Morrow:"Well..Lone Star is safe enough. And we'll need a ship so where better than the shipyards of New Texas eh?" Asha is trying to sound enthusiastic but her spirit's not quite there yet.



Narrator:The bridge settles into a quieter rhythm. The hum of the ship, the faint press of Spirit warding outside the hull, and the small, human sounds of survival: breath, cloth shifting, a boot scuffing the deck.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"New Texas is a place to blend in for most of us. I still find it difficult at times to act human. And i certainly can't pull off looking human. A lot of **Texans** don't approve of my kind, so a prolong visit may not be ideal."

Asha Morrow:"Right, uh, I understand I wasn't implying a long term stay, but we need a ship is all I mean. We can't hang out on Rho's ship forever and I doubt they want us around much either."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Yes, I do see your point. As for whether or not they want us around, is their call." _Kaelith looks over at Lysa, his gaze lingering a bit longer than needed_ "I for one don't mind the company at all."

Lysa Vorren:She keeps one hand near the matrix like she is still on duty, but her eyes drift as Asha says "we need a ship" and never quite come back to neutral.

When Kaelith mentions New Texas and not blending, her gaze flicks to him, then to Asha, measuring. She doesn't interrupt, but the thought is there, sitting behind her eyes.

Her jaw tightens once, not anger, calculation, and she looks away like she is trying to hide it. The wards keep humming, steady and obedient, while Lysa quietly thinks.

"What sort of ship are you planning to buy?"

She tries to ignore Kaelith's stare but can't hide the smirk on her face.

Asha Morrow:"Fair enough I suppose." Asha stands upright then looks over to Lysa to answer her question, "Well I hadn't quite gotten there yet, but..well I have a higher budget than I did when I got my last ship so..bigger?"

Lysa Vorren:Lysa lets Asha's "bigger?" hang for a beat, then she nods like that is the first sensible thing said in hours.

"Good," she says quietly. "Bigger means more spell matrices. More matrices means more mages. I've wanted to fly on something bigger all my life but I don't want to enlist, so it has never happened. I mean, I always wanted to fly a battleship, but at this point I'm just praying to ward a destroyer some day."

"So, I mean, if you need a defensive mage... I know Rho would understand."

She looks entirely guilty at that but just shakes her head, focusing on the wards and the slow, continuous draw on her magic.

Asha Morrow:Asha watches Lysa as she speaks, then looks to Kaelith at the thought of having another mage, then back again "Well, yeah, yall seem to get on alright so why not."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith remains quiet as Lysa and Asha talk, but the mention of needing a defensive mage bring a smile to his face_

Asha Morrow:Asha's face deepens for a moment, "Ugh, I just got most of Rho's crew killed and now I'm poaching his mage this is a little fucked up actually."

she rubs her chin, "He probably wouldn't see it that way though."

Lysa Vorren:She laughs lightly. "We could tell Rho to sell out and join us. Tamsin is his puppy, she would just follow along."

She blushes. "Not literally, I mean that she's loyal."

Asha Morrow:Asha wiggles her fingers at that, thinking aloud "Well a bigger ship needs a bigger crew that fits well actually." she turns to Kaelith, "You like these folk well enough for that? Seems right to me."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Yes, I certainly do. And let's face facts, the events that just unfolded and we lived through have bonded us. A Catalyst run is one thing, but we just survived a God refusing to die."

Asha Morrow:Asha grins, finally "Then we'll bring it up next we see the others."

Lysa Vorren:Lysa grins to herself, biting back the excitement.

"Careful, Captain, you might find yourself the next Wyrm Hunter," she says.

Asha Morrow:Asha stares at Lysa with a wild look in her eyes, "Sounds thrilling!"

Lysa Vorren:She barks out a laugh. "Thrilling, what a choice of words."

She turns a degree more serious. "So, how did you find this place anyway?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"And what about Rho. How do you think he will handle this idea Lysa?"

Asha Morrow:"Ah, well. I think that'll have to wait for when we're properly a crew."

Lysa Vorren:"He's not going to like it. He will grumble and get drunk back at station, wake up and be on board."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks at Asha intently giving her a knowing look_

"He doesn't give off the sharing the captain seat vibes to me."

Lysa Vorren:She raises an eyebrow, turning from the sigils on the matrix rings and stepping out of them. "So what's your ritual for making us official crew? Or is that a metaphor for when we own the ship?"

Lysa Vorren shoots a glance to Kaelith. "Rho wants to be an officer, not a captain. He'll get over it."

Asha Morrow:Asha turns to Kaelith, "Well half the fun of owning a ship is being Captain so he'll have to settle for XO." she turns back to Lysa, "Yeah basically when we're all on the new ship and I know we're in it for real, unless you want to do some kind of ritual." Asha raises her eyebrows like she's kinda into the idea.

Lysa Vorren:"Fair enough," she raises her hands.

"Keep your secrets for now then." She smiles.

Asha Morrow:"You'll like it, promise."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"So how's it feel to be touched Asha? You mentioned curiosity over knowing what magic was like."

Lysa Vorren:"Ohh, it's her first time."

Asha Morrow:she turns, "It is somehow more than I already figured it would be. Quite the experience. My life will likely be defined as pre and post magic from now on."

"Hard to believe there are people like you born into this."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"You picked a big one to lose that virginity to."

Asha Morrow:She belly laughs, "You got that right, god damn."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I wish that I could say that being born into this was easy, but my family would have it no other way."

Lysa Vorren:Lysa coughs, half laughing and trying not to choke on her own spit at Kaelith's remark. "Fuck's sake, Kaelith."

"Write your memoir titled, How I Lost My Virginity To A God's Corpse"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith shrugs and smirks a bit._ "Sorry, just being brutally honest."

Asha Morrow:Asha is losing it, "What the fuck? Ahahaha"

Lysa Vorren:"We will never refer to Catalyzation as that ever again, or I will murder you in your sleep."

Lysa Vorren grins.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Aye, aye."

Lysa Vorren:She just shakes her head, laughing. "This feels good. After all that."

Asha Morrow:"Seriously, I needed that."
