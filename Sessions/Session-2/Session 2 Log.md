Narrator:Asha and Kaelith both independently took contracts that led them to the same target: a derelict Inuran stealth freighter hidden in the asteroid belt near Ternus. Asha was hired on suspiciously generous terms to tow the ship intact to dock, only to find a small salvager crew already on site. Tessa and Joren Arden along with their mage, Kaelith were determined to board. A brief standoff over salvage rights ended when Asha simply clamped on and began towing the freighter away, forcing Tessa to scramble back to her ship and leaving Kaelith and Joren to rush inside and grab whatever they could. Inside, Kaelith powered up the armory and discovered Inuran Mark V spell armor, spellpistols, stims, and an active dream dragon scale also known as an information-storing magical artifact. Joren pushed to the bridge to bring the ship online. Asha, meanwhile, flew a flawless tow back toward Ternus, called in security, and docked under the guns of Ternus marines, ready for a very official, tense handover.

Before security could board, everything went catastrophically wrong. On the bridge of the freighter, Joren, eyes blazing with white light, channeled a spell far beyond Kaelith's understanding through the ship’s dormant matrices. A moment later, a searing purple blast ripped through the docks and obliterated kilometers of bay. Both Asha's corvette and the freighter were thrown clear into space; Asha came away with a cracked rib and Kaelith blacked out briefly. Joren died with his eyes burned out, seemingly drained by whatever he invoked. In the chaos that followed, comms were jammed, emergency lanes lit up, and the orbital station descended into confusion. Asha chose to hold position in space rather than fight her way into a ruined dock. Kaelith, now in the strange, hungry Inuran spell armor, stabilized the freighter and began drifting away from the station. Asha moved to re‑engage; realizing the tow hardware was wrecked, she hailed the freighter and struck a deal with its lone survivor. Together they linked ships, met face‑to‑face (shotgun vs. alien war‑armor), and discovered the truth: this "simple tow" was a lost war‑era supply ship loaded with spell armor for a platoon. Spellrifles and pistols, high‑grade munitions, medical supplies, spare stealth coating, and crates of blank dream dragon scales. Enough wealth to change several lives. With the docks in ruins, their client's motives unclear, and a literal war‑treasure under their boots, Asha and Kaelith ended session one frantically loading as much of the cargo as they could onto Asha's corvette, planning to leave the freighter as the decoy "contract delivery" while they quietly vanish with a fortune.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Welcome, recap above.

OOC: Good evening

Asha Morrow:OOC: hey hey



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - good evening. Taking in the recap real quick

Narrator:OOC - Take your time



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - all caught up

Narrator:OOC: Kicking us off

Emergency traffic strobes still blink in the distant dark where the Ternus docks used to be. They are a ragged gouge of shattered metal and tumbling debris slowly spreading along the station's orbit. Asha's corvette and the Inuran stealth freighter drift far from the chaos in a relatively quiet pocket of space, locked together by an old standard airlock while their drives sit on low power. Inside, the corvette's cramped cargo bays are choked with stolen crates containing dragon scales in padded racks, sleek spellrifles and pistols, sealed medkits, and one spare suit of Inuran spell armor propped like a silent extra passenger. Asha's ribs throb faintly under her body armor every time she moves; Kaelith’s alien war‑plate hums faintly, HUD flickering with unfamiliar Inuran sigils and a slow, unsettling "magic" meter that seems locked at zero. Local comms are jammed with half‑coherent distress calls and rerouted traffic orders, but for the moment no one seems to be looking directly at them. In the hush between panicked transmissions, the two of you have a stolen war cache, a disabled tow contract, a dead tech mage on a drifting freighter, and a rapidly closing window to decide: vanish with the haul, bluff your way back into the system, or try to learn what Joren actually unleashed on Ternus.

OOC: Can you see your tokens in Asha's ship?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I can

Asha Morrow:OOC: yep



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Cool

OOC: Temporarily disabling walls and lighting so we can familiarize with the layout.

Narrator:OOC: And I assume you're on the command deck or somewhere, but place yourself where you like.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks grumpy after moving all that cargo and turns to Kaelith, "We need to decide what to do while the going is good. My original thought was to haul ass outta here, leaving the freighter behind. Any thoughts?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Your ship, your call. I was just here getting what we could get. And we got a ton."

Asha Morrow:She nods, "Let's get out of here then, we have everything." she starts walking towards the command deck expecting Kaelith to follow as she speaks, "I'll disconnect our airlock from the freighter and move it in a way to look like its drifting. I won't dock it, we'll act like I abandoned it after it exploded. Fuck the contract."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follow Asha's lead_

Asha Morrow:Asha proceeds with her plan, "I'll set us off and we'll figure out our destination. You have any known contacts anywhere? I have people out there I could connect with but its hard to know where they'll be so it'd be a guessing game."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Most of my contacts come to me when they need something. I generally don't go looking for work."

Asha Morrow:"Fair enough."



Narrator:Asha has a few options ahead of her here. They would need a ship with a spelldrive to escape through the Umbral Depths. The fact that she has a mage already with her solves half of the problem, assuming that he can perform flame reading and void magic. The odds are low though. And her corvette certainly has no such drive. They could try to escape to free floating station in the solar system, but their range is limited.

Asha Morrow:OOC: Is there a place within range we could reasonably expect to sell off some of the cargo and buy a ship? other than where we are right now?



Narrator:OOC: With gear like this it would probably require you to find somewhere to store it a while and find a buyer. Confederacy is known for begging, so they aren't exactly a great option unless you know a Major or Captain to sell to already. And few people will have battleships in orbit around Ternus waiting for supplies to a tech mage batallion.

OOC: If the trade moon was here, it would be easy. But unfortunately it's not yet.

OOC: The most likely options are to either investigate the ship further, or go to Ternus, or try to piece together a way to escape the system using the Umbral Depths and a spell drive.

Asha straps into the command chair, runs a quick systems check, and severs the airlock link to the freighter with a staged depressurization. She gives the freighter a small, erratic thrust so it drifts and tumbles like a crippled, abandoned hull and kills its transponder. With cargo secured, she applies a clean, quiet burn to back both ships clear of the dock and dials down emissions to a minimal profile. She seeds a faint distress ping and scrubs identifying telemetry to sell the story of an abandoned wreck. Then she sets a low‑visibility course and cuts engines to a slow, off‑grid vector while Kaelith finishes stowing manifests.

OOC: Assuming you went through with the plan as stated, if not just let me know,.

OOC: I would also say not all of your cargo is hard to sell. You can trade dream scales easily.

Asha Morrow:OOC: sorry I'm just thinking about what to do



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: take your time

Asha Morrow:Asha wanders to a cargo bay with medical supplies to check for anything to treat her broken rib while wracking her brain on what to do next.



Narrator:There is an easy button on the crate to open it up, causing an automated mechanism to reveal the contents within. There are dozens of red healing potions carefully tucked into foam padding and stacked in layers. Along the top are two special golden potions, but it's not entirely clear what they are.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows Asha at a slight distance._

Asha Morrow:OOC are healing potions valuable?



Narrator:OOC yes

OOC In general nobody ever sees one other than rich troop battalions and they have some kind of big backing to be keeping any kind of stable supply. They're too consumable to make enough of too really keep anyone stocked.

Asha Morrow:Asha frowns and thinks better of it, focusing on the money. "Ah well." she walks over and turns to Kaelith, "We're a little limited so maybe we need to rethink what's next. We could try to get back on Ternus, maybe sell a bit of whatever we can - only enough to install a spelldrive on the ship so we can leave and try to sell the rest of it elsewhere. Or..I don't know, something else? Maybe the freighter has a spelldrive, but ripping it out is probably beyond what I could do."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I'm sure that thing has a spelldrive, but getting it out before someone gets her might be difficult. I'm sure we can find some contacts to sell enough for a spelldrive on Ternus."



Narrator:OOC: Wait I'm sorry do you have an Inuran corvette?

Asha Morrow:OOC: well there's no other corvette's to choose from so idk, does it make sense for my corvette to be inuran was my concern



Narrator:OOC: Makes sense to me. So it should have had a spelldrive, that was my mistake. Installing one would be easy then, something you can afford with a scale.

OOC: Plenty of orbital facilities around Ternus and farther out that could do it.

OOC: Or yeah just dock on Ternus.

Asha Morrow:OOC would one of those facilities sell them? is the dock at Ternus fucked or could we still get one installed in a reasonable amount of time?



Narrator:OOC: You can get it done in a reasonable amount of time. It'll be a few hours of boring wait to get into the stable part of the docks waiting in line. Then you'd find a mechanic on station and get the parts installed, standard since your ship already supports them. We can skip to you being on the dock and negotiating parts if you want too,

Asha Morrow:OOC sure lets do that



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will leave the armor behind when they head to the docks_



Narrator:You drift in a slow, humming queue of freighters until the clamps bite and the bay doors open onto scorched metal and solvent tang. A short time later you both arrive at the closest shipyard mechanic. The mechanic's alcove is a cramped workshop where a squat, fast-talking drifter fusses over tools, speaking in a rapid mash you barely parse. He eyes Kaelith with keen interest and says to Asha, slowing down only a fraction, that he can install a standard spelldrive in a few hours... if you got the cash.

Asha Morrow:"How much"



Narrator:"How much ye got? Plenty of folk looking for new parts after the shit just happened at the other end of the docks."

He eyes you with a knowing look, you're just as fucked as everyone else.



(To Asha Morrow): Stats for your fighter in a handout for convenience

Asha Morrow:Asha pulls out a dream scale and looks back at the mechanic.



Narrator:The man lets out a long breath, eyes wide. "Foook me, miss. Where'd ye get one of those? Look, I'll throw in a spell cannon and one of those nice universal matrices for ye too. How's about a deal?"

Asha Morrow:She smiles, appreciating his tone "Done." and thrusts the scale over to him.



Narrator:He takes it and it quickly disappears. The drifter is ecstatic and gets to work immediately, letting you know it'll be done in an hour. The time passes quickly with the docks being peak people watching time. There is also an endless stream of news and chaos to check out on the internet. The whole process takes only 53 minutes, with the cannon snapping in nicely on the Inuran corvette and the spell drive being a standard install. If anything, it was a glorified upgrade to her existing model.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith smirks at the mechanic_

Asha Morrow:"Record time too. Is there anything you need to do here either on the dock or on Ternus itself before we leave?"



Narrator:"Oh sure, a back rub and a better fookin supplier of parts. Nah, you get going and clear my docks so I can get more customers in here."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I got no one here that will miss me. I'm ready as soon as the ship is done." _Kaelith's tone is kinda flat and unfeeling as he speaks_



Narrator:"Thassa joke, you stay as long as you want," he adds, somewhat offput by Kaelith's flat tone.

The mechanic turns to leave, business to deal with.

Asha Morrow:Asha rolls her eyes, looking otherwise content or pleased, "Let's get out of here then." she heads to the ship to prepare to leave.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows quickly_



Narrator:The ship is powered up, now bearing a gorgeous spell matrix in the middle of the command deck. It can serve all functions of the ship, navigation, defense, and offense. A pilot can still take manual control of the vessel through the usual panels, but so can a mage through the matrix.

The rings spin in slow, mesmerizing motions, never touching each other. There is a gap where a magic user can duck in and out of them, though they would only cause a minorly painful bump if they hit you.

A mage will also be required to use the spell cannon, someone to feed energy to it and shape the spells going in.

You're prepared to leave.

Asha Morrow:Asha sits down and finally grins, leaning over towards wherever Kaelith is "Now this place is all setup for you, well I mean the weapons at least. _I pilot_." Asha launches them away from the dock.



Narrator:You pull away from the docks and the slowly organizing chaos once again, now floating in free space. The planet looms to the side of your ship and the umbral shadow beckons you for it if only you had the mage to make a long range trip.

Exactly what Kaelith is, Asha is not yet clear on.

Asha Morrow:OOC i see, is that kind of thing not obvious?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:**Kaelith admires the matrix with a devious grin** "You have made my afternoon."



Narrator:OOC: He's a tech mage, but you need specific things to travel the void. Void magic to open a tear, flame reading to find a way through it.

OOC: Another true mage could potentially read what a mage is, but that is its own specialization. They aren't obvious at a glance

The matrix sits at the heart of the command deck, the whole assembly emitting a low, resonant hum that vibrates through the magic in the room pleasantly. The way Kaelith studies the rings suggests he is going to have some fun with them. They practically beg for someone to step into them.

Asha Morrow:"Well, good...I don't suppose you know how to travel the void? Yknow..so we can get somewhere?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Funny you should ask. I do indeed possess the power of the void."

Asha Morrow:She perks up, "And..you can navigate it?"



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Kaelith will probably know that he doesn't have flame reading, since it's a dream-fire aspect. But he _does_ have an active dream scale somewhere in his posessions right now that he can use to supplement the dream component.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): So he can technically navigate it too



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I am not a flame reader, but this dragon scale is active **pulling the scale from his jacket pocket** so I should be tap into it to navigate."



(To Asha Morrow): Anyone knows dragon scales contain information

Asha Morrow:"O-oh, uh, how?"



(To Asha Morrow): Middle class folks would use them to store lots of TV shows for example lol



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I will have to play with the scale and figure out how to utilize the magic in it, but theoretically it can be done."



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Flame reading is seeing past / present / future, you can use it to find your way through the void by knowing which direction to travel, and how long to travel in it, so you know exactly when to exit.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Less of a "seeing in the void" and more like knowing how to move so you end up in the timeline where you're out.

Asha Morrow:"I see..I thought those were like..storage, like memory. Is that a special scale? Where'd you get it from?"



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): might be tough for his first time



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): It will yes



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): It's not easy to cast a spell blindly and to channel a component



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I found this scale before you wrecked my original party." _Kaelith smirks_

Asha Morrow:"On the freighter?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Yes. When I found the armor."

Asha Morrow:"Oh, cool. What's on it?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Haven't had the opportunity to check yet."

Asha Morrow:Asha navigates them to fly a path out somewhere quiet, behind a moon or large asteroid. "Well let's check right now then."



Narrator:Having parked in a quiet spot, shielded from sensors from the inside of the solar system, you are effectively invisible other than your transponder showing you parked.

It's all quiet out here. Traffic is mostly concentrated on Ternus right now.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will check out the dragon scale to see what it may hold_



Narrator:Kaelith holds out the dream scale and pushes a little bit of magic into it. A swirl of purple mist above it materializes quickly into an augury, a recorded vision of someone scrying into the future.

The augury unfurls like a cold proof. Two faces spin into view and you both recognize they are yourselves, the vision precise enough to feel like an exact recording. Seeing themselves replayed in this light hits like a betrayal, or awe, or any number of things. Whatever it is, their faces are here. And then the augury melds away into a view of them on their respective ships, parked at the docks. The observer pulls back and shows both of you in your ships at the docks, minutes before the blast; a searing light erupts, but it's wrong, it doesn't bleed from the freighter or its bridge but splashes out from the station itself, concentrated along walls and ceiling ribs in jagged, uneven shafts, as if the station were the thing being burned open. The observer's view stays untouched by the glare, able to watch without flinch, which makes the moment feel both rehearsed and deliberate rather than chaotic. Then the tableau folds away into a cold, humming star-map: every known catalyst in the galaxy, annotated with tiny sigils. One node in particular is traced in red outline with a path leading to the Ternus system. A single locus the augury insists is important.

But what could possibly be more important than this already priceless artifact. A map of every catalyst just doesn't exist.

Not just a map, someone knew this would happen, and knew you two were involved.

OOC: By "one node in particular" I mean, one catalyst.

Asha Morrow:Asha stares out at the augury quietly, mouth slightly open. She turns to Kaelith and holds out a hand like _what the fuck_ but still speechless. Asha turns back to her command console and checks on the location of the red node, where would she be headed?



Narrator:Comparing the red node on the galactic map of the dream scale to your own console, you see it would be the Destrian system. It's abandoned, taken over by primals and any record of who once lived there has been long lost. There are no trade lanes out that way or traffic whatsoever. It's far too, at least a week in the void by your ship's quick math.

Asha Morrow:OOC what's a primal?



Narrator:OOC Primals are attracted to the corpses of dead gods and when they find them they tend to align to them and defend them. They can take almost any form. A flame catalyst may have elementals around it. An earth catalyst may be guarded by megafauna.

OOC They are super dangerous and scale based on the power of the catalyst



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"This is a fucking gold mine. Our goldmine Captain. By the way, the names Kaelith."

Asha Morrow:She smiles, "Asha. I agree, we stumbled on insanity." she stares down at her map, "I wonder why this catalyst is red on their map. Is there anything else in the scale, any explanations or..well anything?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"With this map we could collect the power from all aspects of magic."

Asha Morrow:"Well sure, but I mean why is one of them red?"

"I checked and it would take awhile to get there, so I'm not sure if we should rush off there, but I'm curious now."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Well obviously it stands out for some reason. Red, perhaps for danger. Maybe it's where the map maker resides. I can't say I really know for sure."

Asha Morrow:OOC so in a corvette manned by two people, it'd be pretty silly to go check out a catalyst and deal with primals, right? you said super dangerous so it wouldn't make sense to be tempted rn?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC It would be silly and dangerous and doing such a thing usually ends in death. But people have done crazier things.

OOC Maybe like a 7 out of 10 on the universal scale of bad choices for two people without a lot of experience

Asha Morrow:OOC i dont have those odds

OOC hate*



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: :)



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Perhaps it would be best if we find a dream Catalyst so that I may attempt to harness it's power and be able to navigate the void more competently."



Narrator:As if somewhat sentient, the galactic map highlights the already highlighted sector again in response to Kaelith. The sigil beside the red marked system is Dream.

The continuous soft pink glow cast over the deck is almost calming, if a bit eerie.

Asha Morrow:Asha stares a little too long, mildly awe-struck at the map. "Well.." she scratches her head, "Its safer to find somewhere to sell off this cargo..but making a trip to a catalyst and maybe actually coming into contact with it is..mighty tempting." she looks around her command deck as if expecting someone to be there, "Its just you and me though, even with some of the gear we found do you really think we can do this?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Unloading some of this cargo and lining our pockets might be the best start. And then maybe getting us a capable crew."

Asha Morrow:"Yeah that makes sense to me."

OOC: What are some places that would be appropriate for offloading some of this gear?



Narrator:OOC: You could sell it off at Shaya, or a drifter trade colony, or over at New Texas where they are making ships en masse.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I don't think anyone I know would be able to buy any of this. Maybe we could pawn it off in New Texas. Their always looking for weaponry."

Asha Morrow:Asha tilts her head, "Yeah, I happen to like New Texas so that could be nice. Maybe we could get some more ship mods or a new one entirely while we're there." Asha taps her console checking the distance to New Texas



Narrator:New Texas is close enough to reach with a couple weeks of regular engine burn. You can also go through the Umbral Depths and be there in less than a day.

Asha Morrow:Asha studies the route for just a moment and turns back to Kaelith, "Can you get us through the Umbral Depths or not? It'd take a couple of weeks to get there normally, which I'm equipped for, but it could be much faster if you can."



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Basic process is she navigates into a planet's shadow. You open a void rift there (spell check), then inside you navigate by flame, then at the other end you open another rift and exit. Easy peasy.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I'll warn you, I'm no expert at it, but I possess the ability to do it. We could end up somewhere else."

Asha Morrow:She weighs the options of a multi-week burn or possibly ending up somewhere undesirable, then shrugs. "How bad could it be? Let's do it."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith nods_ "Get us into the shadow of a planet and I'll do the rest."

Asha Morrow:Asha navigates accordingly.



Narrator:Asha's ship glides silently through space, passing into the umbral shadow of Ternus. It's dark here, as good a spot as any to tear a hole in reality.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith begins the process of manipulating the matrix and ripping the hole in space_



Sshado C. (GM):Cost is two pool, spellcasting + expression check

DC will be 1 to open a void rift

And you can hit the corresponding void sigil on the matrix to cast through the ship

Same as hard casting (sketching sigils in the air) except you can just tap them on the rings basically



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:

|Kaelith Voryn-Shai|
|---|
|Spellcasting|
|5 Successes|
|(4+1) Intuition  <br>(3+0) Spellcasting (TN4)  <br>(0) Bonus Dice  <br>(0) Edge|



Narrator:Purple cracks in reality appear in front of Asha's ship. They spider out like fracturing glass and begin to tear into a blackness far deeper than anything in the external universe. The Umbral Depths actively consume light, not just lack it. But it moves in some imperceptible manner. You know it cannot be empty.

Before passing into it, the ship must go completely dark other than residual onboard power for crew systems. There can be no major spell casting during transit. Anything that could attract attention in the Umbral Depths is a serious and immediate risk to the life of anyone traveling through it.

Once you are in, Kaelith will need to discern the heading and time by flame reading and tell Asha how to set it. Then they have to lean back and keep calm.

Asha Morrow:Asha sets up the ship to safely enter the Umbral Depths then looks towards Kaelith, expecting instructions on their heading.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Sorry the cost for that was one pool. It doesn't really matter here, you're not in combat.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will begin mapping out the way_



Sshado C. (GM):DC 3 with flame reading to discern the heading using the dream scale, no cost to pool because it feeds enough magic on its own.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - it's all a spellcating roll correct



Narrator:OOC - Plus expression yeah



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:

|Kaelith Voryn-Shai|
|---|
|Spellcasting|
|5 Successes|
|(4+1) Intuition  <br>(3+0) Spellcasting (TN4)  <br>(0) Bonus Dice  <br>(0) Edge|



Narrator:Kaelith places his hand over the scale and draws slowly upward, pulling dream magic from it and lacing it with fire, pulling the light into his hand and then clenching his fist around it, leaving only a soft glow around his hand. When he opens his fist it is a calm, gentle light. He peers into the flames and moments later gives Asha the correct heading. It will take four hours, twelve minutes.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I need to figure out how to change the difficulty of the rolls



Narrator:OOC - Same!

OOC - You have time to chat, or just whisper me when you're done with the scene and want to transit over.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"So...this is kind of an interesting accidental partnership now isn't it?"

Asha Morrow:Asha smiles and orients the ship according to what Kaelith directed. "Much better than a couple _weeks_." she nods, "Definitely the most exciting thing that's happened to me in quite some time. We've stumbled on easily the biggest opportunity of each our lives."

"While I was towing the freighter I didn't imagine I'd be partnering up with one of you.."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Yes we have. And it may draw us some unwanted enemies." _Kaelith chuckles a bit_ "One of me? A mage? Or a Shayan? Which are you rereferring?" _Kaelith smiles_

Asha Morrow:She raises her eyebrows with a smirk, "One of the salvagers I mean, now that you mention it though I am surprised somebody like you were there at all."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Are you still in power armor Kaelith?

OOC: Spell armor rather



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - He would put it back on when they got back on the ship.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - ok thanks

OOC - Visor down so you can talk normally I presume



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): he would also play around with the armors hungry feel and maybe push some spell pool into it



Narrator:While you are both speaking, Kaelith's armor lets out a quiet hum for a moment without any indication that he did anything. Kaelith, the magic you tried to push in was drank in greedily, causing you to snap back from it instinctually. If your visor is up you will see on the HUD that the magic meter now has the faintest line on it of charge.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - visor down



Narrator:OOC - No sighting of the magic meter but you'll see it eventually

The effect of the suit drinking your magic leaves a pounding headache and a disgusting buzzing in your head. It feels terrible and wrong.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith visibly winches from ache_ "Wow! Won't be doing that again."

Asha Morrow:Asha's face scrunches in concern, "Are you okay? What just happened?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"This armor. It is spell armor. I tried to feed it. And it happily took it and gave me a headache."

Asha Morrow:"Ohh, I wonder what that _feels_ like, its hard for me to imagine. I considered the other spell armor we have in the cargo, but I'm not sure how useful they are to someone who isn't a mage."

OOC would I know that kind of thing, having being in the Confederacy?



Narrator:OOC You'd know you can't use it, yeah.

Asha Morrow:OOC cool



Narrator:OOC I mean, it's armor. Better than nothing.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I honestly have no idea if you can use it."



(To Asha Morrow): You would also know that armor doesn't drink magic



(To Asha Morrow): Whatever Kaelith is up to, it's pretty fuckin weird

Asha Morrow:"Without magic, probably not the way you can. Though maybe its rating is better than what I have on." she taps her light body armor, "I've never heard of armor drinking magic though, that sounds unusual to me."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I don't really know much about the armor, but I'm all about trying it out."

Asha Morrow:"Well..don't hurt yourself I guess." she chuckles



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I'll try not to."

Asha Morrow:Asha leans back in her chair and sighs, "My mind is racing, thinking of all the ways to go about what we'll do next. If we sell a lot we could have enough for a whole new ship, but do we need one? I've never fought Primals before, have you? As for hiring a crew..what do we tell them? I don't think we should mention the catalyst map but we'd have to make up something about how we know where to find one.."



(To Asha Morrow): Shayan lore now that you have seen him and heard him say out loud he's a Shayan, it may or may not affect how Asha sees him. The Confederacy is the _Shayan_ Confederacy, Ternus is just a member of it. They generally are your allies, but the Shayans have also some fraught history and are blamed for some of the major losses of Ternus. Their people tend to be stuck up assholes, but not all of them. Those who are decent people are pleasant. They can be a little self righteous, but cherish life since their planet is basically one giant life tree. They also are beautiful, and live for a loooong time.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I have not fought Primals, but I know they can be brutal. As for the crew, we can hook them with just one mention of a single catalyst. I think we need a few soldiers and maybe another gunner."

Asha Morrow:She nods, "Yeah, that would be very helpful." Asha looks at Kaelith for awhile, contemplating her question before she goes for it "So, stop me if this is impolite to ask, but I'm curious; How old are you?"



(To Asha Morrow): good question because they literally don't age as long as they consume magic



(To Asha Morrow): I mean physically anyway



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): I'm not boring you to death am I



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith laughs_ "I am not offended at all. We Shayans age differently than humans."



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Not at all. I was looking for ages of Shayans

Asha Morrow:she grins, "Right. So..am I like a baby compared to you or what?"



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Cool, just checking in. I think they live indefinitely, just have to consume magic to keep their youth more or less.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): I forget how old Kaelith is though, I'm curious now too haha



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I would not presume to know your age, but yes, you are quite young in comparison."



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): I don't think I ever picked an age

Asha Morrow:"Heh fair enough." Asha absentmindedly checks their time to New Texas.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"The good news for you is that you now possess a mind that has years of accumulated knowledge."



Narrator:You're coming up on the window, just about ten minutes out.

Asha Morrow:"Well, I'll consider the cherry on top to the recent boons we've acquired. We're almost there by the way."



Narrator:OOC: When you're ready, you can open another void rift out.

Asha Morrow:OOC me? or kaelith



Narrator:OOC The mage :D

Narrator:The ceaseless void ahead of the ship splits open, purple cracks in reality spidering out and tearing into a hole back to reality. Through it you see New Texas, the dark side of it at least. Everything seems normal. The orbital shipyards in the distance are active - they never sleep.

Your ship passes through and as you leave the void you feel like you can breathe again. There is something deeply wrong with the depths.

OOC: We don't have time to set up another scene so you can chat for ten minutes or call it, no big deal either way.

Asha Morrow:Asha gives a pleased grin, setting their course to dock, "Well its official, I love space travel with a mage."

OOC: I'm good either way



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith giggles_ "Oh, New Texas. What a sight to see."

Asha Morrow:"Been here before?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I been here a few times on jobs. How about you?"

Asha Morrow:"Yeah, not frequently though. I'd been all over the place while a Confederate. I like the food here mostly." She suddenly craves barbecue.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"The food is pretty good, I'll give you that. What i like is you can always find what your looking for here."

Asha Morrow:"Well that'll be the best part for us right now, I can hardly think of a better place to sell all the random military hardware we have."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Oh absolutely"



Narrator:The corvette glides out of the planet's shadow and toward the orbital docks where most of the population. The planet below is stunning. With most of the population wiped out, the surface is mostly just used for crop farming now, growing animals and food. The lack of pollution and minimal human tampering compared to Ternus is a sight indeed.

In juxtaposition, the orbital shipyards are swarmed with destroyers, cruisers, and battleships at the moment. Looks like another wave is heading out.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks like a giddy child staring out towards the planet and again at all the ships. Space is the place for her, no doubt about that. "We're coming up to the docks, we'll get settled here in no time and I'll set out to finding a contact of mine or someone else who'd buy in bulk."



Narrator:OOC: Well this was nice. I'm glad we had a chance to meet the characters a bit more and learn a little about Asha and Kaelith tonight

OOC: Put you two in a room and you'll yap as usual :D

Asha Morrow:OOC yeah thanks for the chance to chat a little one on one



Narrator:OOC now I'm wondering how old Kaelith is

OOC Also Asha seems to really enjoy space. Seems like she isn't the type to stay on a rock long

Asha Morrow:OOC same, I can't believe he dodged the question. well thanks for the session yall!



Narrator:OOC THanks yall



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I can accompany you if you'd like or I can make some rounds on my own. Whatever you think works best."

OOC - LOL I'll come up with an age
