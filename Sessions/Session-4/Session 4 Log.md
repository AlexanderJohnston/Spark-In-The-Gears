Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - until we meet again

OOC - Evening all

Asha Morrow:OOC hihi



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Hey good evening

OOC - How's everyone



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - quick note about next week. I have my daughter's holiday chorus concert next week. It starts at 6 but I should be home by 7 so we could start late if y'all want or just skip.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - I'm fine with trying a short session as long as you don't think it'll be inconvenient for you.

OOC - We can just start when you get back and settled in

Asha Morrow:OOC sounds good



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - shouldn't be a problem at all



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - So last time you sold your war freighter haul, made Maris very rich, and hired Black Trace to go poke a god corpse. Take a moment to think about and describe what your character would have been up to in the 8-12 hours waiting for everything to be off-loaded so you can leave.

Asha Morrow:Asha would likely spend 1-2 hours winding down, take around 4 hours to sleep probably on her ship, spend another hour waking up and eating, then any remaining time being fully prepared with both her personal gear and generally fretting over her ship's systems.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:*Kaelith heads for the store to stock up on some potions. a half dozen mana beers, maybe two greater mana beers, and the same quantities of counterspell and greater counterspell potions. He would also try to speak with either Rho or Lysa about getting Comm units capable of linking with theirs. He to would catch a few hours of sleep and then spend the remaining time learning what he can about the Spell Armor



Narrator:Asha, the eight‑odd hours between deal and departure vanish in pieces: a hot shower that never quite washes the station smoke out of your hair, four hours of dead sleep in your bunk with the ship’s hum like a heartbeat under your ribs, then lukewarm coffee and checklists. Systems lights march down your boards in orderly green: spell drive idle‑ready, spell cannon slaved to the matrix, armor and weapons stowed exactly where your hands will want them when things go wrong. By the time Lone Star’s chrono rolls over to departure slot, your fretting over every readout has settled into something harder and simpler. This is as ready as she gets.

Kaelith's hours blur with the quieter commerce of war: a narrow, overbright station shop where a bored clerk slides cases of mana beer and neatly labeled counterspell vials across the counter; a brief, practical meeting with Rho's quartermaster to sync long‑range squad comm bands so Black Trace and Asha's corvette can talk without the station listening in. Sleep comes in a few shallow hours on the bunk they've given you, spell armor standing in the corner like a silent, waiting animal, its HUD faintly pulsing as you nudge at its systems and learn its hungers; by the time you're back on the bridge, helmet sealed, it feels less like borrowed relic and more like an extension of your own intent.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Kaelith, the total will run you 4350 credits. Are you using money he already has?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - if he has enough already, yes. if not he would ask for an advance from Asha

Asha Morrow:OOC we got the 12(?)million from Maris right, I'm sure we would split that



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Perfect, I'll add it to your sheets

OOC: We'll say Kaelith has 5,995,650 left



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - ok by me



Narrator:Lone Star Station peels away in layers. First it is all close metal and glare, gantries and floodlights sliding past the viewports as tugs shove your corvette clear of the docks; then the big shapes fall back, destroyer hulls and half-built cruisers and the slow wheel of the civilian ring turning into a band of gray against the stars. New Texas itself shrinks on the aft display, a blue-green coin under a mesh of defense grids, until it is just another bright circle in the dark and the only thing ahead of you is black.

Rho's ship settles off your starboard quarter, running lights turned down, a squat working shape with too many guns and engines to be anything but serious.

"Black Trace on your wing, Morrow. You call the jump, we follow," his voice comes over the shared comms link steady and dry.

Out past both hulls the local star burns cold and white, and your nav overlay draws a long, tapering cone of shadow the planet swallows the light of the system's star.

Rho Anselm:"We're pulling in right behind you and above your wake within visual range. We're going to let Kaelith handle the void transit."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Kaelith, DT 1 spellcasting when you decide to open it and then a DT 2 to use the dream scale to read flames for a path.

Asha Morrow:"Heard." Asha sets the route and speaks to Kaelith, "On your mark Kaelith."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Right, In 3" **Kaelith begins drawing sigils in the air** "2, 1, MARK!"

dream scale roll



Narrator:Reality cracks apart as fingers of void rip through the shadows like purple tendrils of glass. They spread apart, revealing the depths which seem to swallow any concept of light itself. Both ships slide into the umbral depths running dark, weapons cold. A few minutes later and more sigils sketched by Kaelith and their course is set. A few hours transit to sit and mentally prepare for what awaits them at the Catalyst.

OOC: Nice double 5s by the way

Asha Morrow:Asha leans back, "Nice."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Thanks Captain."

Rho Anselm:"Smooth work. Our wards are up and I'm getting a nap. Call if you need something."

( over comms )

Asha Morrow:(over comms) "Will do." Asha cranes her neck to look over at Kaelith, "You do that a lot? Seems natural to you."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - are there multiple seats on the bridge?

Asha Morrow:OOC for sure



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Ship is meant for a crew of 5-10

OOC - So at least a few chairs I think

OOC - And Asha has final say on it anyway



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith strolls over and takes a seat in the chair closest to Asha_ "Magic comes naturally to me. And void chose me during my Rite of Communion. Although I must admit the flame reading is a new talent."



Narrator:sha, on the bridge with most of the ship running dark and the only real light coming from your consoles and the faint glow of the spell-matrix, there is suddenly nothing urgent to push buttons for and a whole lot of time to sit with the fact that you pointed your livelihood at a dead god; what does that look like in her body language?

Asha*

Kaelith, the ship wards are holding almost too cleanly under your hands, the dream scale a cool, constant weight in your awareness and the Umbral currents slip past like wind over glass, so you have attention to spare. How is Kaelith feeling about this impending Catalyst?

Asha Morrow:Asha is feigning a relaxed posture but anyone paying attention would see the persistent tension underneath. Her mind is on, she's thinking about everything, about death, what happens when if she lives to touch the Catalyst? Death. The high likelihood of death. She'll frequently think of missions gone wrong, of dead crewmates long passed. Of a particularly bad moment in her military career where it was nothing short of a miracle Asha survived at all. She pushes those thoughts aside, "Despite everything I don't know much about your people..at least I don't know much coming straight from a Shayan themself. Hear lots from others."



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): If you have any questions about Shaya lmk, happy to fill in



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): otherwise just have fun with it



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith sinks back into his chair and rests his hands behind his head. He takes a few moments to admire the efficiency with which he now seems to handle traversing the Umbral Space. A brief smile crosses his usually stoic face. Kaelith relaxes in the moment, but does not loose track of the path the ship is on. Kaelith has often thought about the next Catalyst he would touch, but never expected Dream to come this quickly in his life. He does not fear the dead gods and thus does not feel overly emotional about this journey._

_Kaelith looks to his Captain_ "My life, my family I should say was one of the revered families on Shaya. We are born magically inclined and up until me, always Life mages. And protectors of the TREE. I cannot explain to you what it is to be Shayan, only what it is to be a Voryn-Shai."



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): I'm sure the books delve much deeper than the system book, but my feel is that they are essentially space elves. LOL

Asha Morrow:Asha leans on her left arm, looking back at Kaelith, "Well that sounds really important and fancy to me, so why are you here and not there? Because you are a Void mage?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Essentially yes. Some of my family wanted me sacrificed thinking I was an evil seed in our lineage, some desired my expulsion from Shaya. Regardless, the best I would have seen on Shaya was the inside of a prison. So my mother help me escape. and I have spent nearly 100 years trying to fit in amongst humans and scraping up work where I can."

Asha Morrow:"Oh..that's awful."



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Yes :)



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): they are not complicated, they are space elves and have a Tender who is their leader who protects the tree and channels its power, and a snobby council of mostly true mages



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Kaelith was a council or Tender's son, I forgot but it's on his background if I recall



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Mostly they are super religious about Shaya and many of them about Voria, who is still very active in the galaxy whereas Shaya is dead



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"It is truly what it is Asha. Any way, I have grown to view it much differently since I am void touched and have a knowledge not many of my people have. You cannot have Life without Death and void is just that. Any many other things as well, but void represents the entropy of all things."



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): The background says the Circle of Lifebinders

Asha Morrow:"Huh..I guess after 100 years one could get used to anything. I have to say I am curious what magic _feels_ like, yknow? You talk about Void being death and entropy, but what does that _feel_ like when you open a tear into the Umbral Depths?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Mages come in different packages and all view magic on a personal level. War Mages and Tech mages are different breeds than I. I am a true mage and one who was basically born to be a mage. Magic is very innate to me. Etching the sigils my art, and commanding my flames my dance as though directing workers in a factory."

Asha Morrow:Asha tilts her head side to side, "Maybe I'll never understand it any more than I understand artists, there's just something you feel and _see_ differently than I am able to."

"Do you think we'll live to touch the Catalyst? Dream?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Well, I could attempt to use the dream scale and find out. But if you are asking for my opinion, then the answer is yes. A resounding yes. It is my opinion that my destiny will be found through the power of all the elements of magic."

Asha Morrow:Asha grins, "Must be nice to have all the answers already."



Narrator:The on-board computer lightly pings, signaling that the exit is minutes out at this point.

Asha Morrow:Asha sits upright and pings Rho to ensure they're ready as they approach.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I can only claim to have my feelings, desires, and devotion. The answers will come to us though our actions."

Rho Anselm:"Understood, we're right behind you."

"Everyone should get environmental suits on. Armor up. Prepare for the worst, hull breach, anything."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith rises and heads to the Matrix and prepares to drag the two vessels out of the Umbra_



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: DT 1 void casting to rip a hole. No spell pool needed if you do it through the ship matrix.

Asha Morrow:Asha reacts to Rho's advice and dons whatever suit she has ready for such an occasion.



Narrator:The spelldrive hums quietly as it channels void from Kaelith, leaving a fleeting feeling in his chest of magic being torn away by the machine.

Realspace slams back in like a held breath, and for a long second the only thing in the viewports is black, honest vacuum, not the infinite abyss of the Umbral Depths. Then the stars resolve and the shadow fills in around you: a cold, airless planet hanging below like a dark coin, its night side swallowing starlight, and beyond it a wide band of stone and ice arcing across the system, an asteroid belt so broad it looks like someone hammered a scar through the sky. Your corvette and Black Trace’s ship drift together inside the planet’s umbral cone, drives idling low; HUDs bloom with fresh sensor returns, static still crackling from the jump, while somewhere out there, deeper in the belt, something tugs at trajectories just enough to register as wrong. Rocks drift a half‑degree off expected, a faint smear of dream-magic in the background band like someone whispering through the static.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Opportunity for Basic Navigation, Sensor, or Spellcasting to confirm you're not under anyone's eyes, or whether or not you're alone.

Asha Morrow:Asha will absolutely analyze anything at her disposal to check their surroundings and situation.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Also just checking, everyone knows what an umbral shadow is right? It's both a good hiding spot and a bad one. Everyone knows that's where you will transit from, but being close to the planet is also like being under cover at first.

Asha Morrow:OOC the dark side of the planet i figured right



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: yup yup

Asha Morrow:OOC also what would the Sensor roll be



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Hidden DT here

Asha Morrow:OOC right but what do i roll



Sshado C. (GM):OOC Oh sorry

OOC From the piloting cheat sheet it's hidden under pilot actions: Perception (Sensors Scan):

Spend an action to scan a target.

DT1 – Public ID, basic info, positions.

DT2 – Velocity, possible trajectory.

DT3 – Trajectory, likely destinations.



Sshado C. (GM): DT4+ – Technical details; DT depends on how obscure/valuable the knowledge is.

Rho Anselm:"All clear. Neither our mage or sensors are picking up anything here."

"I'm pulling long range scan on the Catalyst right now and see if we can't find a way inside."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - what would the roll be for a magical scan? And does it require specific elements?

Asha Morrow:"I'll follow your lead."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Spellcasting for example using Divination, but I don't think you have any

Narrator:Kaelith hard casts fire and then dream, holding the scale in one hand. The magic courses through his arm and disappears into his body. His mind is taken away to a future moment. Asha is there, so are Black Trace, at least some of them. Behind him something swarms, ahead of him is the gap between the mandible of Aashitak's jaw and the spine at the back of what was once her throat. The frozen flesh barely resembles anything organic, and the bone protudes through it many places where it has either been eaten or eroded away. Part of the spine has broken away, revealing a light within it that draws Kaelith in, calling to him, but it's too far away. Asha will never make it.

Suddenly he's back on the bridge.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith shakes himself back into the present_ "I see nothing but the light of the Catalyst calling to me. The rotting corpse of a long dead God waiting. It will not be easy and I get the feeling something will eventually show itself to us. But this is why we are here, what we have come to collect."

Rho Anselm:"Asha, Lysa is telling me the Catalyst is likely somewhere inside the corpse. We're not seeing anything on the surface. Did whoever told you about this place mention anything like that?"

Asha Morrow:Asha stares at Kaelith and shakes it off to respond to Rho, "No, I didn't know how the setup would be just that it'd be here."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Lysa is correct Rho. I have seen the Catalyst. It lies through the mouth, buried in the broken spine of Aashitak."

Rho Anselm:"Well, I don't know how you want to play this, but I'd take that info and fly it right down the throat until we find somewhere to park as close as possible without attracting attention."

Asha Morrow:While glancing at Kaelith, "Works for us."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith nods_

Rho Anselm:"Following your lead then. Guns are hot."

Asha Morrow:Asha sets a route to follow their plan to go down the throat of Aashitak.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Let me get a Navigation check (DT 3) for a stealthy approach while keeping engines low.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will climb into his SpellArmor and load 2 greater mana beer and a counterspell potion in the potion loader._



Narrator:The HUD on Kaelith's helmet eagerly lights up with two dark blue and one misty lavendar colored potion on his loader bar.

Asha Morrow:OOC navigation as opposed to piloting?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Piloting check coming. Navigation to figure out an approach, Piloting to execute it in the moment.

OOC - running the dogs out. be back asap



Narrator:Just as Asha is about to hit the burn hard with no well-covered route in, Kaelith points out an asteroid which is headed right for an eye socket. They can piggy back behind it and ride it in, then break away to slip into the jaw at the last minute.

It's an absolute crapshoot that he managed to spot it among the field of tens of thousands of rocks.

Asha Morrow:Asha gladly adjusts their course to utilize the asteroid Kaelith spotted for a more hidden approach.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - back



Narrator:The moment Kaelith pings the rock on her HUD, Asha sees it - the fat, tumbling asteroid on a near-perfect intercept for one of Aashitak's hollow eye sockets, its bulk already dragging a faint wake of dust and glittering Dreamglass behind it. She trims the corvette's burn, slides the vector over a hair's breadth, and then pours the throttle back in, nestling her ship into the asteroid"s shadow so close that the forward cameras are mostly spinning stone and the occasional flash of off white bone far ahead; to any watcher in the belt, she is just turbulence in the big rock's exhaust as the pair of them fall toward the god's face.

Narrator:As the improvised cover grows into a looming wall that fills the view, she rides its motion with small, precise bursts of thrust, bleeding speed just enough that, at the last possible moment before the asteroid slams past the socket's rim, she kicks the corvette sideways and down. The hull skims the edge of Aashitak's fractured brow like a thrown blade, then drops out of the rock's shadow and into the deeper dark of the open mouth below, Asha threading the gap between two jagged teeth of bone with centimeters to spare and leaving the sacrificial asteroid to plow on ahead as the only obvious thing anyone, or anything, should have noticed.

The first wisps come in like fog. Their forms are pale, eel-slick strands of light that drift up from Aashitak's bones and coil around the corvette''s hull, smearing across the viewports as if something on the other side of the glass is trying to remember your shape. Asha watches her boards flicker as readings multiply: false proximity alarms, phantom engine temps, a dozen contradictory nav pings that feel less like bad sensors and more like something gently pushing every number out of tune. Deep in the drive readouts, timing markers begin to stutter a fraction of a second off-beat, threatening a misfire that would kick the ship sideways into the densest part of the wisp swarm.

Narrator:She has no room to kill thrust, so she flies through it. Asha's hands are light on the controls as she ignores the lying overlays and flies by the few instruments that still ring true, trimming power with quick manual overrides. Outside, the Dream-primals thicken into half-formed shapes that snap at the corvette''s wake and leave trails of cold static across the hull, but Asha rides the jitter in the drive like turbulence, rolling the ship between drifting knots of light and letting the worst of it slough off against Aashitak's own bone.

Asha Morrow:Asha is sitting forward in her chair and upright, tense as she maneuvers, "We're not done yet!"

Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"We need to get the ship as close as we can. Those primals will be on us once we leave the ship."



Narrator:The deeper the corvette slides into Aashitak's jaw, the more the space ahead looks like an exposed landscape instead of a skull. Miles of off-white bone ridges and valleys, knotted with old fractures and frozen flesh, glazed in dream glass and puddled black globs of decayed marrow that reflect false constellations. Out on the broader planes and higher ridges she can see the movement now: humanoid eidolons walking patrol-like arcs, hound-shaped Nightmares loping on too many limbs, and loose skeins of wisps streaming between splinters of black crystals like they are following some silent weather pattern in the dreamfield. But the surface is so vast that it is easy to disappear in the small places, and Asha finally picks out a shallow valley between two fused ridges where bone has sagged and cracked into a dish-shaped hollow, a pocket of relative quiet hidden under the shadow of a jutting spur.

Any closer and she risks alerting the natives to them, but it's going to be a hard, twenty minute sprint on foot at best.

Asha Morrow:Asha relays to Rho, "Think this is the best we'll get, but we have a..._spicy_ run on foot from here."

Rho Anselm:"Fuck it! It's as close as we're getting. No getting cold feet now, we're IN THE SHIT!"

"By the way, if we ever fly together again then I'm taking point. You are mad."

Asha Morrow:She blows air out of her nose, "That's a compliment." Asha stands up and looks to Kaelith, "Take what you need if you don't have it already, we're stepping outside."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"You got any Earth mages on the rig of your's Rho?"

Rho Anselm:"Nope, just Lysa. She has Fire and Spirit."

"What are ya thinking?"



Narrator:Assha coasts the last stretch on minimal thrust, letting the ship settle in low behind a jag of broken marrow so that from above they are just another dark gap in the godflesh, power levels dropping one by one until only life support and a thin skein of wards hum in the background. From the bridge, the view out is a tilted slice of Aashitak's skin-plain crawling with distant primals, but down here in the groove the noise of the dreamfield feels muted, like the wake of the Half-Slumbering cannot quite reach into this crack, and for the first time since they arrived the corvette feels small enough to be truly hidden.

Rho brings Black Trace in low and dirty, tucking his scarred gunship into the same sagging valley on the far side of Aashitaks bone ridge so that, from above, the two ships read like nothing more than a pair of shadows in a world made of scars. When his landing struts bite into fossilized marrow, the side ramp slams down and twenty mercs spill out in disciplined fireteams, armor scuffed and guns hot, fanning into a tight perimeter while Mudcat lopes off to run a quick radiation and atmosphere sweep, Lysa closes her eyes to listen for anything paying them too much attention, and Tamsin ghost-walks up the nearest rise to set a long gun where she can see both the approach to the Catalyst and anything that might come sniffing at their hides.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I wanted some fortitude infusion for this run, but we may have to try some other strategies. If we keep the group small enough, i can cloak us in darkness."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Food just came out. Want to take 5 real quick since we're about halfway?

OOC: Stretch the old legs, get water

Asha Morrow:Asha grabs her shotgun and heads outside, waving for Kaelith to follow.

OOC works for me



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - go for it



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - All right :)

OOC - Good opportunity to reminder to use the cheat sheets and also bear with me as we figure out combat. Conceptually it's quite easy. Standard initiative system. You get two actions which can be anything, double movement, double attack, move and attack, etc...

OOC - Generally it's Brace for melee defense, Dodge for ranged, and Skepticism for magic. Accuracy adds a die to the roll. Double range on weapons is +2 DT. Movement is Agility _2 in meters. Sprint is agility_ 5 but uses both actions.

And Rolling to Hit is easy. For example, if Asha has 3 agility and 4 ranged, she rolls 7 dice to to shoot a rifle. If she meets or exceeds opponent's defense then the attaack hits. Damage is base damage + 1 for each extra success on the hit.

OOC: Likewise, Kaelith with a spell rifle would use literally the same dice. Agility and Ranged, since it's a gun.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - can hard casting be done in this armor or does he need to use a rifle?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - No problem to hard cast in armor

OOC - True mage wouldn't be caught dead without some armor on



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - good, cause he has no ranged ability



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Okay settling back in now

OOC - _cracks knuckles_

Lysa Vorren glances sharply at Asha. "Captain, I don't think we were spotted. We have at least a few minutes to plan here."

Rho Anselm:Rho waves to Tamsin and makes some private hand signal which Tamsin then returns. Rho glances back over his shoulder at Asha, then Kaelith. "Clear up to the ridge at least."

Asha Morrow:Asha looks back at Lysa then suddenly at Rho, receiving his information "Good, the _plan_ is to keep moving. This need to be in and out, the longer we're out here the higher the chance we get _stuck_ out here."

Judd "Mudcat" Harrow:"Atmos is thin but walkable if you like your lungs lightly seasoned with nightmare, so masks on and keep your wards tight; radiation's low, but whatever's in the air out there ain't in any medical manual I trust. You give me ten and I can rig us a little fallback line right here, but if we're takin that jog, I'd rather not loiter in the god's teeth any longer than we have to."

"Asha's right."

Rho Anselm:"Let's move it then," he starts calling out instructions to the other twenty mercs with them. The company all move up in loose formation toward the ridge where Tamsin is prone.

(The company being him and the mercs, Lysa and Mudcat are hanging with you two)



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows behind the main group keeping keen eye on their surroundings_

Asha Morrow:Asha looks over to Kaelith, "Let's get after it." Asha follows along with the company towards the ridge.

Lysa Vorren:Lysa has a mark III spell armor on, Shayan make unlike Kaelith's Inuran armor. Hers is significantly less advanced though. Kaelith looks like some kind of elite unit next to her.

She follows along near Kaelith, spell rifle aimed low but ready.

Judd "Mudcat" Harrow:Mudcat follows on the other side of Asha and ahead slightly. He picks up pace and hits the ridge hard if it weren't for the low gravity.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Kaelith says quietly, keep a tight formation and i'll make us dark if need be."

Asha Morrow:Asha keeps pace, shotgun ready in her hands.



Narrator:The climb to the ridge is short but ugly, boots crunching over frost-stiff bone and old flesh, breath loud in helmets as something presses faintly at the edges of thought. When Asha, Rho, and the point elements of Black Trace crest the lip and go prone beside Tamsin, the view over the far side steals what is left of their idle conversation: a vast, sloping plain of Aashitak''s inner jaw running down toward the broken spine, the distance between here and there a hard twenty-minute sprint even at full push in low gravity. Far ahead, the severed vertebrae rise like shattered white pillars as large as entire cities out of a slow river of crystallized pink-blood and ice, void Shards jutting from the wound in a ragged, black crown that drinks the light and leaks it back in strangely colored shadows.

Between the ridge and that impossible landmark, the plain crawls. Humanoid eidolons patrol in loose ranks along invisible lines of force, some wearing bone masks, some half-faded at the edges like they cannot quite decide to be real; packs of Nightmare hounds pace wider, circling and re-circling scent trails that never quite lead them to the valley where the ships lie hidden. Wisps stream overhead in curling ribbons, riding currents only they can feel, occasionally dipping low to brush against patches of strange resin that glisten like a purple oil in old impact craters. There are gaps: faintly quieter channels between patrol routes, shallow depressions and jagged bone ridges that sketch a broken, indirect path toward the spine, just barely wide enough for a small, fast team willing to trust in speed, shadows, and whatever cover a dead god' jaw will give them.

Asha Morrow:Asha follows that indirect path with her eyes considering it quietly, options are thin here. She points it out and traces a path, "This might be our way forward. Do you see there? If we follow the gaps between patrols we have a chance without drawing too much attention."

Rho Anselm:He is quiet for a long moment. "Your call, Asha. I don't know about sneaking this many people through, so we should plan to dead sprint if we do."

"We ain't dumb, it's just that things don't always go clean out on catalysts."

Asha Morrow:"Well I didn't say _sneak_, time is short here so a dead sprint was always the only way across this plain."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith listens keenly to the conversation going on, but also tries to rummage through the controls of this armor to see what it can do_



Narrator:Kaelith, your suit is awake and actively filling its magic meter for the first time since you found it. It's slow right now, but it's climbing. There is an intense draw for you to touch that catalyst now that you can see it. And having seen this interface enough, you know it has advanced thrusters. You're practically impossible to catch if you try, you could abandon these folk and be there before they even make it five hundred meters.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): specifically looking for flight options



Narrator:Specifically, your suit is capable of pushing 90kph faster than the fastest you can imagine already pushing it.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): guess you answered before I commented. lol



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): ;D



Narrator:OOC: Advanced Flight Optimization with +2 magical metamaterial, so it's 30 kph times 3 for the bonus, aka, fuckoff level of fast.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): and how much weight can it carry in flight?



Narrator:OOC: A human can move Agility _5 meters in a sprint. You can move an additional 150 meters in one turn on top of what you could already move in spell armor during flight. (90000 meters / 3600 seconds_ 6 seconds per turn average)



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): As much as you can carry

Rho Anselm:"All right, I'm going first. I've seen the most catalysts out of anyone here. Maybe I'll get lucky."

"Ready?"

Asha Morrow:"Right behind you."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Lead on Rho.":



Narrator:Rho breaks into a quick jog and leads the way down the ridge, picking a path that cuts through jagged shards and overhangs of bone. For the first minute things are relatively quiet with everyone on edge but the group traveling through a chunk that was carved out of the bone here long ago.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will maintain the speed of the group_



Narrator:The rest of Black Trace snaps into motion behind him, a long staggered ribbon of bodies dropping into the first shallow depression Asha pointed out. Low gravity makes every stride a bounding glide; boots leave the bone in sprays of frost and Dreamglass dust, then come down again in time with the soft hiss of breath over mics and the muted chime of Kaelith's armor as his suit quietly keeps pace without ever really needing to try.

Asha Morrow:Asha follows behind Rho, keeping pace.

Narrator:They pour down the broken, indirect path like water seeking the deepest channels, skirting the edges of patrol routes where eidolons walk their ghostly lines and circling wide around the arcs where Nightmare hounds lift their heads to taste the air. Wisps drift overhead, some dipping low enough that helmet lenses catch a smear of color and a whisper of something trying to see inside, but Lysa's quiet, steady warding and Kaelith's looming presence keep the worst of the attention sliding off them like they are just another dream fragment washing past.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_As they move, Kaelith will begin drawing the sigils cast Infuse Strength upon himself_



Narrator:Things are going too well right up until you blink and find yourselves alone in a dense jungle. There is a small stream beside you no more than five feet wide and ankle deep. Otherwise the sudden presence is oppressive. There are bugs everywhere swarming around you, crashing into your armor. Old vines and leaves snag at your boots and shoulders.

Narrator:You know _where_ you are supposed to be, Kaelith, but the magic here is overwhelming your senses. Everything is steeped in syrup-thick dream magic that you cannot see through. Asha, you can discern that you're definitely in a jungle, definitely not where you should be.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks around to see who, if anyone is with him_



Narrator:There is nobody around. You hear a piercing howl and know the woods are alive, watching you. You're not alone, but it isn't your companions.

Asha Morrow:Asha is head down at this, focusing on keeping pace and heading _forward_, however general of a concept that might be in this disoriented state.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith casts piercing gaze_



Narrator:Asha keeps her head down and pushes, picking a direction that feels like "forward" and driving her legs through the tangle without giving the jungle timeto argue. Vines snag at her greaves, branches slap against her visor, insects rattle on her armor in sheets, but she forces a rhythm out of it: step, shove, breathe, repeat, refusing to let the howls and the wrongness in the air slow her. After what feels like several minutes of hard slog the ground tilts under her boots, the thin stream now running at her feet in the same direction she is going instead of across her path, and for a disorienting heartbeat she has the sick certainty that she has been walking in circles around a single, unseen point that is watching to see how long she will keep playing along.

Asha Morrow:Asha stops and looks around for any sign of a companion or a way _forward_.



Narrator:Kaelith's sigils burn into his vision, and the jungle peels away like wet paper; with Piercing Gaze pledged, the syrup-thick dreamfield thins and then shatters, and in the next blink he is back on Aashitak's jaw, boots on bone, low gravity tugging exactly the way it should. The plain snaps into brutal clarity: Black Trace spread out along the indirect path mid-sprint, some of them stumbling or firing wildly at things only they can see, two mercs down on one knee clutching at invisible wounds while wisps cling to their helmets and shoulders like threads of pale fungus.

Ahead, Asha is running hard and straight, shotgun low, pace perfect but eyes unfocused, her stride just slightly out of sync with the real terrain as if she is following a path only the dream wants her to see. Overhead, Kaelith can now see the true shapes of the primals riding them: filaments of Dreamlight netted between wisps and eidolons out on the flanks, all of it tugging at his comrades' senses, trying to drag them sideways into pocket jungles and buried memories. With Piercing Gaze active, those lines stand out like glowing tripwires against the stark white of Aashitak's bone, and Kaelith is suddenly the only one here who can see both the trap and the way through it.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - Did the Infuse Strength spell work?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Oh yes, sorry

OOC - Let's say it did



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - ok, that gives Kaelith a 4 strength now



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - God damn!



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:*Kaelith will take to the air and find Lysa and Asha. He will swoop in and grab them both before kicking the armor into full gear and maneuvering through the tripwires towards the Catalyst



Narrator:Asha is forcibly yanked from the dream, literally into the air by an iron grip like steel on her armor. Kaelith has Lysa in the other hand and is moving along at a breakneck pace. The thrusters on his armor are like perfectly shaped jets of void like precision knives through the air. The ground below is a blur as he moves well over 100 kph toward the catalyst.

Asha Morrow:"W-what the fuck is happening!?"

Lysa Vorren:Lysa, hyperventilating, tries to shout into her comms, "KAELITH- WHAT- IS- HAPPENING---"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Relax, I have you both. The Dreams were overtaking us all."

"Who else do i need to grab once i sit you down safe?"

Lysa Vorren:"Rho, Tam, Mudcat! Whoever you can get!"

"Did everyone get caught in it?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"As far as I can tell we all were caught in the trap."

Lysa Vorren:She points ahead as they're nearing the catalyst rapidly. Within seconds Kaelith will reach it. "Set us down just beside it there!"

Asha Morrow:"Oo-oh fuck this disorienting.."

As Kaelith slows, something massive grazes past him just narrowly missing him. A shard of black crystal the size of a tank digs itself into the ground where he should have been.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith calls over the comms_ "Tamsin, report!"

Asha Morrow:Asha turns to try to look at the black crystal in disbelief as they pass.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai: _Kaelith looks to where the shard came from_



Narrator:No reply over the comms other than the incoherent screaming and confusion of people in the jungle still.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Shit!"



Narrator:The Lacuna shard that nearly took Kaelith's head is not alone. As it finishes skidding and digs to a halt in the godflesh, a second and third black crystal the size of dropships slam into the jaw further out, each impact sending a teeth-rattling vibration through the bone and kicking up plumes of powdered bone that hang in the air like ghostly fire. For a heartbeat it looks random, like debris falling from some unseen orbit, until Kaelith's sharpened sight catches the pattern: the shards are not falling, they are being thrown.

Far above the ragged crown of Lacuna Shards that seal Aashitak's sundered spine, something impossibly vast uncoils: a wyrm of splintered bone ribs and flesh seething with pink colored light, its body threading in and out of reality as it wraps around the shard ring. Chunks of entropic bone grind against crystal with a sound like glaciers breaking, and every time one of its coils passes through the physical the air around the team thickens, colors oversaturate, and for a moment they see themselves from outside, like pieces on a board the Guardian is studying. One titanic skull, half-formed and mask-like, turns just enough that empty sockets line up with the little knot of figures by the Catalyst, and a surge of cold, focused awareness slams through the dream, pinning every mortal mind there with the crushing certainty that The Half-Slumbering is no longer content to just dream of them.

(Everyone is safely down on the ground if they want to be)

Lysa Vorren:Lysa scrambles away and straight for the catalyst. "Kaelith, RUN!"



Narrator:The crack in the spine ahead is utterly massive. The hole itself might as well be a great lake, and within it a forest of impossible vast cables like thick redwood trees made of glass making up each nerve fiber of Aashitak. They glow with a syrupy pink light which threatens to overwhelm you, yet somehow you can see through it at the same time.

You can choose to stay and fight or run.

Asha Morrow:Asha turns and hits a dead sprint towards the catalyst, saying nothing as the adrenaline fueled tunnel vision hits.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"GO! RUN!" Kaelith begins to run towards the crack in the spine and the Catalyst that lies inside. He keeps pace with Asha and Lysa, not wanting to leave them behind*



Narrator:As you pass through the crack into the spinal column you pass out of conscious reality. An infinite pool of pink light stretches out before you, around you, through every atom in every cell of your body. An ocean of power within a mind so vast that you are not even a drop. You become that consciousness and the universe stretches out before you through thousands of senses you can not comprehend.

You are old, ancient enough to understand how the world was created. You were there to see the very first strands of the realm of Dream woven into existence using magic. You understand the eight aspects and the paths which can be accessed by combining them. The complexities behind true magic seem trivial. You were there when reality was created. One of the oldest Gods, not a Titan, but close.

The power is endless. You could create a world, an entire species, or extinguish one. You have already done so before; you watched as your children were hunted and extinguished by many younger Gods.

One in particular fades into memory, and suddenly you realize you have a body. You _are_ Aashitak, curled up in the realm of Dream, surrounded by those who would one day become your children. You, Aashitak, distinctly feel the sensation of being watched by two of your own children. You are staring down at both of them and they stare back. Asha and Kaelith stare at themselves through the eyes of Aashitak.

Then suddenly the dream is torn. A vast seam of void erupts around Aashitak. Through the tear, two vast arms like rings of a planet reach through and wrap themselves around Aashitak, pulling her down, through reality, into the Umbral Depths.

"WHERE... IS... ETERRA?" screams your brother, Zenzuata.



Narrator:"Zen, you fool," Aashitak says. "She's gone."

The void around you shudders as Zenzuata’s grip tightens, his ringed arms grinding against the fabric of Dream, and fissures of nothing begin to spiderweb out from where he holds you. For a heartbeat that could be an eon, you feel three perspectives at once: Aashitak’s ancient sorrow, Asha’s vertigo as her own eyes gaze back at her from her creator’s face, and Kaelith’s cold, analytical awareness mapping every fracture of the Dream as if it were a battlefield about to be lost. In that overlapping instant of selves, you understand that Zenzuata is not merely tearing at you, but at reality itself, each crack in reality reaching backwards, searching for every thread where she ever was so that he can unmake the answer to his question.

"If you do this, Talifax won't stop with just _killing you_. Don't you see he has deceived us? Nobody will be able to oppose him, Zen. Eterra chose to die so we COULD fight!"

All Zenzuata can do is scream. A deep sense of pain and grief overwhelms you. Gods can't truly die, not the same way mortals can. They can be shattered and their pieces scattered across the cosmos, but they will always try to pull themselves back together. The overwhelming loss you feel is the feeling of your being torn back across space and time, erased, pushed into the void. In a moment of desperation you unleash everything, dumping your power and freezing yourself into perpetual dream, forcefully locking your body across multiple domains. Your head in the dream, your chest in reality, and the rest forever being dragged into the umbral depths by Zenzuata.

As you fade from the memories of Aashitak, you remember her conversations with the keeper of secrets. You recall conversations with Reveanthara and Xal about The Great Cycle. The endless whispers in the libraries of someone who cannot be named woven by his arachne librarian seers. The secrets of the universe unfold like plain logic and conversation. You feel the pull to fall deeper into it. (DT 3 Skepticism Check)

OOC - so luck it is



Narrator:Asha, you find yourself _affixed_ to the nearest trunk of crystal nerve fiber. It has formed some kind of a crust against your armor on the gauntlets, arms, anywhere that was in contact. It's growing as you stare at it, but it's not strong enough to hold you here yet.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_As the vision fades, Kaelith looks for Asha and Lysa_

Asha Morrow:Asha pulls away from it, using any free appendage to try and break herself free if necessary.



Narrator:Kaelith finds Asha pulling herself free a few meters away, and beside her is Lysa who is still lost in an empty-eyed stare with the crystals growing steadily around her armor.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will break Lysa free from the crystals_



Narrator:Asha, as you pull away you feel an overwhelming sense of power rush through you for the first time in your life. Every sense is alight with raw power. You don't just feel strong, you feel _great_, like you could forget what hunger and pain were. You can taste the magic in the air, feel your hands move through it like a thick syrup. You can push on it and tug at it, and it moves through you. Within that energy you feel Aashitak's mind pulsing quietly, silent but there. Not part of your soul, but part of the magic it moves. A shape imprinted onto your own, that of a god. Within it an endless ocean of knowledge just out of your reach, and with that comes a certain draw to drink more deeply of the power here. But you know you still have a mission to do.

Kaelith, you are suffused with raw dream magic. For the first time in your life you see the literal flows of magic in the world around you. Asha does not know how rare this is, an unheard-of gift. The entire world is magic. You can see at least void, fire, and dream swirling around you. With them are many other colors but not ones you can properly perceive yet. You can only presume they are the other elements.

The possibilities scream at your mind to drink further, Kaelith. This is not just a god corpse, this is something old from the beginning of the universe.

Kaelith easily removes Lysa from the crystal nerve fibers and only then does she finally awaken.

Lysa Vorren:She shivers, looking around in bleary confusion. "What... happened?" Through her helmet you can see something has changed about her skin, but there isn't time to inspect things.

Asha Morrow:Asha steadies herself and holds back the urge to vomit as the disorientation fades. Her new senses feel overwhelming, overstimulating, like a muscle she hasn't been using it feels unwieldy. Asha turns back to stare at the crystal nerve fiber, momentarily forgetting where she is as she considers _greed_. She didn't expect to feel so _good_.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"We have found something magnificent and it is overwhelming all our senses."

Lysa Vorren:"Kaelith... it's so beautiful. Did you see her?"

"Oh my gosh, I can see... can you see what I'm seeing right now?" Her gaze trails toward the opening and the Guardian perched outside of it, staring in at them silently. The wyrm's eye socket swirls with pink light but lacks any sort of flesh.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I have seen many beings in this dream state. We have a choice. Leave now while we can or risk our lives for the power she offers."

_Kaelith focuses his senses in the direction Lysa is looking_

Lysa Vorren:Lysa steadies herself and begins walking toward the exit, stumbling more than once. She heads for the Guardian.

Asha Morrow:Asha snaps back into focus and looks around, watching Lysa then looks to Kaelith, "What are we doing? Should we fly out?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - is the guardian blocking the exit or the way to the center of the Catalyst?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Depends on your definition of blocking. You can walk out, but it's right there.

OOC - You can walk past it if it doesn't move



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith grabs Lysa's shoulder_ "Where are you going?"

Lysa Vorren:She raises a hand weakly toward the wyrm. "I'm going to appeal to him," she says quietly. "Maybe live."

Asha Morrow:"What?"

Lysa Vorren:"The guardian," she says, staring at Asha blankly.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith holds Lysa tight for the moment and Concentrates on the Guardian trying to get a feel for it's intention_

Asha Morrow:"C-can they be reasoned with? Appealed to? That's..normal?"



Narrator:Being this close to it and attuned to Aashitak now, you can sense that it is barely restrained. Murderous intent rolls off it in waves, but something is holding it back.

Lysa Vorren:"Yes, that might as well be a minor god. They are sentient."

"Aashitak must have chosen the wyrm. She chose us too."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Something is holding it back from killing us."

Lysa Vorren:She tries to pull away from Kaelith's grip.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith holds firm_

Lysa Vorren:"Release me, Shayan."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I can't let you just walk out to your death Lysa."

Lysa Vorren:She closes her eyes for a moment and stops fighting. "Fine. What are we doing?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks deeper into the spinal column for the center of the Catalyst_

Asha Morrow:Asha looks around for any other openings, somewhere they could slip by or something they could use. "Beats me, right now I think praying might be good."



Narrator:Kaelith searches but can only determine he is in the center of the catalyst. The magic here is like a column of water all through the spine.

(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): have we absorbed enough Dream to have achieved Catalyzation?



(To Asha Morrow): You see one nerve fiber you could walk along for a few hundred meters and come out further down, slightly closer to your ship. There must be others if you're willing to follow the outer edge of the spinal column for a while since you are between vertebrae.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Oh yes you have



Narrator:OOC: Catalyzation you both gained:

Granted powers:

Dream magic

+1 Charisma

3 spells, 3 more pool, 3 more resistance of Dream

If you survive the lethal dream surrounding Aashitak and reach the nerve column of its spine, then Aashitak will dispense her dream sight into you. It grants a degree of awareness into the plane of Dream.



Narrator:**Essence Sight**

Effect: See the flows of magic in the world.

Duration: Until concentration is broken.

Uses: Unlimited

OOC: 3 spells can also be multiple ranks of a spell as far as I understand it. But I need to confirm tbh.

Asha Morrow:OOC we reached the nerve column right, we have that essence sight?



Narrator:OOC: You do, you can see magic now at will. You have to opt into it because it will stop as soon as you stop concentrating.

OOC: You can't discern details of magic you don't have but you can still see it flow. You just wouldn't know fire from void from air, if you don't have any of them.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks back to the Guardian_ "Well ladies, if we intend to leave we need to do it together."

Asha Morrow:Asha points towards a nerve fiber not too far, "We could go there, walk that and end up closer to the ship. At least avoiding the Guardian for the moment. Who knows how it will respond.."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Can't be worse than walking right at it."

Asha Morrow:"Lets go then." Asha leads the way



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith waits for Lysa to follow ad then follows her_



Narrator:As soon as you step onto the nerve fiber you feel your essence dragging downward. It is like the overpowering feeling of needing to sleep, wishing even to sleep. Each step seems to stick, your boots cracking away with freshly grown crystal each time. You continue on this way, one foot in front of the other until you reach another break in the vertebrae.

Outside seems clear at least as far as you can see for a hundred meters before the terrain dips away.

In the distance you roughly discern where your ship should be, though it's tucked out of view in the crevasse.

Lysa Vorren:"Now what?"

Asha Morrow:Asha points to where the ship should be, "Kaelith, can you fly us again? Are you good? Ship should be there, roughly."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks out upon the scene that had been a battlefield looking for Rho and the rest of his mercenary band_

Lysa Vorren:"I'll fly myself, thank you."

On cue, she hovers off the ground a few feet effortlessly.

Asha Morrow:"Okay, then fly me. Let's get the fuck out."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith grabs Asha and takes flight, circling over the spine looking for any survivors_

Asha Morrow:Asha looks specifically for Rho or Tamsin.



Narrator:You break free from the center of the catalyst in flight and immediately the guardian takes off, heading after you. A voice bellows, echoing impossibly through the space. "_Every primal here knows where you are now. I may not be able to touch you, but **they will**. I don't know why Aashitak chose you but her secret dies with you._"

The guardian follows at a distance, tailing you lazily as if to show that you never stood a chance at outrunning it.

Asha Morrow:"W-..doesn't that kind of go against the _spirit_ of what Aashitak wants? You really think she would appreciate you using a _loophole_? What the fuck.."



Narrator:Kaelith passes over the carnage below where Black Trace has been largely slaughtered. Rho can be seen firing wildly into a group of nightmare hounds. An Eidolon leaps off an outcropping of bone and crashes into the ground, shattering bone around it as it the force knocks Rho off his feet. Tamsin is on another ridge nearby, raining down clean shots one after another which only serve to enrage the Eidolon as they chip away at it.

Asha Morrow:Asha points to Rho, "Kaelith grab Rho and we can go save Tamsin, quick!"

The Half-Slumberling:The guardian lets loose a deep, slow laugh at Asha. "I am Aashitak. She is dead, her power is mine. You will obey or you will die."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Pick up the pace Lysa. I'll get Rho!" _Kaelith takes a direct route towards Rho and prepares to snag him_

Asha Morrow:Asha is mumbling now, "But you said Aashitak chose us.._you_ chose us and also want us dead? Or you lie.." she shakes her head mumbling more obscenities

"Fucking gods."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Rho do you copy?"



Narrator:The eidolon lashes out at Rho and sends him flying, tumbling end over end into another outcropping of bone. It shatters around him and he struggles to get up, looking like one of his legs is failing him.

Rho Anselm:"Kaelith?" he coughs into his mic. His nose sounds broken and his voice wrong. "Fuck me, I didn't think you made it. We need help immediately. I'm-

...I'm-" he is interrupted by a large chunk of bone being flung at him. Rho dodges out of the way narrowly.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Coming in hot. 11 o'clock. Give me an arm in the air."

The Half-Slumberling:The wyrm laughs again at Asha's remark. "So young, what is a child doing at a catalyst like this? Who sent you?"

It dives, circling and nearly grazing Kaelith, close enough for its eye to pass just meters from Asha's face.

For a moment they lock gazes as it passes.

Rho Anselm:Rho thrusts an arm up and stares up into the sky, finally spotting Kaelith.

Asha Morrow:Asha recoils and her face contorts in fear and awe in equal measures. She has to catch her breath, still mumbling, "After what just happened I think Aashitak sent us.."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith dives down, slowing only enough not to rip Rho's arm from the socket before snagging him up and engaging thrusters and making a beeline to the ships._

The Half-Slumberling:"IMPOSSIBLE."

"How do you know this?"

Narrator:OOC: Jesus

Asha Morrow:Asha clings to Kaelith as he maneuvers around, in disbelief that she is having a conversation while doing this, "She _saw_ us, in the _past_. Her last moments I think.."



Narrator:Kaelith moves like a tech mage who been flying for thirty years in this moment. The spell armor _wants_ to be pushed and he uses the tool like a natural extension of his body. He swoops, grasping Rho tightly and lifting him and Asha back into the air heading straight for the ship.

The Half-Slumberling:"Then you know she was betrayed."

He swoops past again, staring fixedly at Asha.

Asha Morrow:"Yes."



Narrator:Below, the ship comes into view. It's swarming with eidolon, at least another dozen.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Tamsin! Fall back to the ship. HOW COPY?"



Narrator:Tamsin can be seen about five hundred meters back, sprinting for her life.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"I'm... moving... as fast... as I can... hold the damn ship1"

( ship!" * )

The Half-Slumberling:"Do you know who it was?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Mudcat. How Copy?"



Narrator:Silence on the radio from him.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"He's fucking dead, Kaelith," she chokes out, though from exhaustion or emotion it's not clear.

Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith closes in on the ship and makes a hard turn, using the thrusters against the ship as brakes, then drops Asha and Rho and makes a full burn towards Tamsin_

The Half-Slumberling:"The _why_ is simple. Your companion is wearing it on his skin," the hair-raising voice bellows back at Asha.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Get one of those fucking birds ready for flight."



Narrator:Asha and Rho are dropped unceremoniously on top of Asha's corvette. Around it on the ground are the eidolons, now turning their attention to the two of you.

Asha Morrow:Asha sprints for her ship, trying to respond between breaths, "What does armor (_breath_) have to do with it?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Wearing it on my skin." _Kaelith says aloud but sounding confused_



Narrator:Kaelith, the indicator for magic on your hud is finally at 100%. A symbol glows, awaiting your activation.

The Half-Slumberling:The reply from the wyrm comes out like the dying breath of a forest of trees whose leaves all sing the name in dreadful unison, "_Nefarious_."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith ignores the symbol for now looking to get Tamsin out of the fire_



Narrator:Tamsin has made it only two hundred meters out of the five hundred, and she is already swarmed. Her sprint has turned into a backwards jog as she sinks round after round into a small swarm of eidolon and hounds chasing her. Hounds rush her and get clipped by rounds every few seconds.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"I need covering fire RIGHT NOW!"

Asha Morrow:"Is that a (_breath_) person?" Asha is heading for any opening at this point, sprinting to avoid any eidolon for as long as possible.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"WHERE ARE THE MAGES?" she screams into her mic.

The Half-Slumberling:"Ohhhh no," he chuckles at Asha, diving and then crashing into a perch just behind her ship. He lifts a clawed foot and plants it directly on the ship, pinning it in place. "Not a person, a God."

"The Great Consumer. The Unending Maw. The Endless Hunger. The Devourer Of Systems."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith sweeps down upon the pursuing swarm and unleashes void bolts into the group_



Sshado C. (GM):Roll for two void bolts, regular magnitude or boosted?

Asha Morrow:Asha turns to look up at the guardian, instinctively activating Essence Sight to see the magic flow around it.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - boosted



Narrator:OOC - You have 2 magic, so +1 boosted each, 4 pool cost total.

OOC - and two rolls for attack



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - technically 3 magic now with dream



Narrator:OOC - +1 being +2 damage I believe

OOC - Right 3, so +2 or +3 damage

OOC - +2 magnitude*

OOC - and that means 2 auto successes too

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Tamsin will be swarmed within one turn.

Everyone can take one additional action.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will fly at full speed and try to crash through the horde a few feet off the ground_

When Essence Sight snaps into focus, the Half-Slumbering stops being a monster and becomes a wound in the world: a vast, tangled knot of Dream-light coiled around the shattered spine, every scale and rib a conduit where Aashitak’s remaining power is being siphoned and rerouted instead of radiating freely. The wyrm’s body is threaded through with blinding currents that run out into the eidolons, hounds, and wisps, each primal lit like a bulb on a circuit it controls, while great ropes of that same light dive back into the Guardian. Where its gaze passes over Asha and Kaelith, she can see the flows stutter and split around the Inuran armor on his skin, the Guardian’s Dream trying and failing to run cleanly through something in him that drinks a different kind of power, leaving a jagged, hungry void in the pattern that even a dead god’s usurper cannot quite read.

The Half-Slumberling:Whatever is going on with Kaelith's armor, it is clearly disturbing the Guardian for a good reason.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Kaelith give me an Athletics check with your strength as a bonus.

OOC: If you get 3 or more then define how you want to crash in. You can incapacitate several of them, or bowl a bunch over, or sky's the limit.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks _sad_, this feeling coming from a place she can't describe as if seeing something tragic that shouldn't be, "Kaelith you have to do something, it's reacting to your armor."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_As Kaelith approaches the horde, he extends both arms holding them firm and extended attempting to decapitate anything he hits_

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Tamsin stumbles, falling right on her face as Kaelith carves into the swarm, unfortunately wasting the time he saved her. Several dozen eidolons decapitated, an equal number of hounds shredded. She turns, screaming a war cry into her headset as she unloads rounds into the swarm.



Narrator:Natural one for her, you need some kind of large AOE to save her.

Kaelith's HUD continues to glow ready to fire. There is some kind of readout on it showing number of targets, hundreds.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Get down Tamsin. NOW!" _Kaelith engages whatever has fully charged_



Narrator:Kaelith activates the suit and is hit with a wave of nausea and buzzing in his head like someone just ran it through a bucket of white static. His suit rises straight into the air fifty meters and explodes with black tendrils of vicious, snaking energy. They erupt faster than the eye can follow and attach themselves to every primal for hundreds of meters in every direction. There is a screaming of many voices as suddenly an immense amount of magic is siphoned straight into Kaelith's suit. It drinks in the very light around it, causing space to seem almost devoid of color near his armor.

Kaelith, you feel a staggering and uncontrollable amount of energy being pulled through the suit. You need to direct it somewhere, and you realize in this moment this is a God-killing weapon.

The Half-Slumberling:"WHAAAAT HAAAAVE YOU DONE?!" the Guardian cries out, his claw immediately crushing Asha's ship like a tin can.

OOC: Good thing you unloaded that cargo



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Before we end, what do you do with the beam, Kaelith?
