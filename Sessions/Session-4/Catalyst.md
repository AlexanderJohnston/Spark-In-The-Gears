An infinite pool of pink light stretches out before you, around you, through every atom in every cell of your body. An ocean of power within a mind so vast that you are not even a drop. You become that consciousness and the universe stretches out before you through thousands of senses you can not comprehend.

You are old, ancient enough to understand how the world was created. You were there to see the very first strands of the realm of Dream woven into existence using magic. You understand the eight aspects and the paths which can be accessed by combining them. The complexities behind true magic seem trivial. You were there when reality was created. One of the oldest Gods, not a Titan, but close.

The power is endless. You could create a world, an entire species, or extinguish one. You have already done so before; you watched as your children were hunted and extinguished by many younger Gods.

One in particular fades into memory, and suddenly you realize you have a body. You *are* Aashitak, curled up in the realm of Dream, surrounded by those who would one day become your children. You, Aashitak, distinctly feel the sensation of being watched by two of your own children. You are staring down at both of them and they stare back. Asha and Kaelith stare at themselves through the eyes of Aashitak.

Then suddenly the dream is torn. A vast seam of void erupts around Aashitak. Through the tear, two vast arms like rings of a planet reach through and wrap themselves around Aashitak, pulling her down.

"WHERE... IS... TERRA?" screams your brother, Zenzuata. 

"Zen, you fool."
