An infinite pool of pink light stretches out before you, around you, through every atom in every cell of your body. An ocean of power within a mind so vast that you are not even a drop. You become that consciousness and the universe stretches out before you through thousands of senses you can not comprehend.

You are old, ancient enough to understand how the world was created. You were there to see the very first strands of the realm of Dream woven into existence using magic. You understand the eight aspects and the paths which can be accessed by combining them. The complexities behind true magic seem trivial. You were there when reality was created. One of the oldest Gods, not a Titan, but close.

The power is endless. You could create a world, an entire species, or extinguish one. You have already done so before; you watched as your children were hunted and extinguished by many younger Gods.

One in particular fades into memory, and suddenly you realize you have a body. You *are* Aashitak, curled up in the realm of Dream, surrounded by those who would one day become your children. You, Aashitak, distinctly feel the sensation of being watched by two of your own children. You are staring down at both of them and they stare back. Asha and Kaelith stare at themselves through the eyes of Aashitak.

Then suddenly the dream is torn. A vast seam of void erupts around Aashitak. Through the tear, two vast arms like rings of a planet reach through and wrap themselves around Aashitak, pulling her down.

"WHERE... IS... ETERRA?" screams your brother, Zenzuata. 

"Zen, you fool," Aashitak says. "She's gone."

The void around you shudders as Zenzuata’s grip tightens, his ringed arms grinding against the fabric of Dream, and fissures of nothing begin to spiderweb out from where he holds you. For a heartbeat that could be an eon, you feel three perspectives at once: Aashitak’s ancient sorrow, Asha’s vertigo as her own eyes gaze back at her from her creator’s face, and Kaelith’s cold, analytical awareness mapping every fracture of the Dream as if it were a battlefield about to be lost. In that overlapping instant of selves, you understand that Zenzuata is not merely tearing at you, but at reality itself, each crack in reality reaching backwards, searching for every thread where she ever was so that he can unmake the answer to his question.

"If you do this, Talifax won't stop with just *killing you*. Don't you see he has deceived us? Nobody will be able to oppose him, Zen. Eterra chose to die so we COULD fight!"

All Zenzuata can do is scream. A deep sense of pain and grief overwhelms you. Gods can't truly die, not the same way mortals can. They can be shattered and their pieces scattered across the cosmos, but they will always try to pull themselves back together. The overwhelming loss you feel is the feeling of your being torn back across space and time, erased, pushed into the void. In a moment of desperation you unleash everything, dumping your power and freezing yourself into perpetual dream, forcefully locking your body across multiple domains. Your head in the dream, your chest in reality, and the rest forever being dragged into the umbral depths by Zenzuata.

As you fade from the memories of Aashitak, you remember her conversations with the keeper of secrets. You recall conversations with Reveanthara and Xal about The Great Cycle. The endless whispers in the libraries of someone who cannot be named woven by his arachne librarian seers. The secrets of the universe unfold like plain logic and conversation. You feel the pull to fall deeper into it. (DT 3 Skepticism Check)
