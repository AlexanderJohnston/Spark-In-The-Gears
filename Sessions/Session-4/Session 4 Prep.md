# Session 4 (As Run) – Canon Notes (derived from Session 4 Log)

_Last updated: 2025-12-16_

## What this file is now

- This file started as a prep outline, but Session 4 is complete.
- It is now a **canonical Session 4 summary + current state** for continuing play (Session 5).
- If anything here conflicts with `Sessions/Session-4/Session 4 Log.md`, the log wins.

---

## Where Session 3 Left Off (still accurate)

**PCs / status:**
- **Asha Morrow** – Inuran corvette captain, now at Lone Star Station (New Texas orbit).
  - Ship upgraded with:
    - **Spell drive** (void-capable via matrix).
    - **Spell cannon** slaved to the onboard matrix (one mage can run nav/defense/offense through it).
  - Personally retained: one suit of Inuran spell armor, a spell rifle, a spell pistol, 2 healing potions, some blank dream scales.
- **Kaelith Voryn-Shai** – Shayan true mage (Void/Fire/Dream leaning), in Inuran Mark V spell armor that "drinks" magic into its own meter. Also holding at least one active dream scale (the galactic Catalyst map) plus extra scales he stowed in quarters.

**Big score resolved:**
- They sold off the derelict Inuran war-freighter’s cargo through **Maris "Ledger" Konn** on Lone Star.
  - Estimated raw value ~1.5–2 billion credits.
  - Deal: Maris handles laundering, bribes, logistics.
    - ~30% lost to bribes/labor/paperwork.
    - Remaining split **60/40 in Asha’s favor** (Asha 60%, Maris 40%).
  - Asha already has **12M** advanced as a "joke" / goodwill escrow to buy supplies, recruit, etc.
  - They **kept** at least:
    - Second Inuran spell-armor suit.
    - Stealth coating kit for a ship.
    - Some med supplies / stims and a sample of the other war gear.

**Crew recruitment on New Texas:**
- Via Maris, Asha contacted **Rho Anselm** (ex-Confed, merc captain of **Black Trace**).
- Core Black Trace faces:
  - **Rho Anselm** – leader, ex-Confed captain, pragmatic, experienced with Primals/Catalyst ops.
  - **"Mudcat" Harrow** – New Texas engineer/grease wizard, keeps ships and spell armor running on duct tape.
  - **Lysa Vorren** – true mage with Catalyst experience and warding; very interested in Dream Catalysts.
  - **Tamsin "Longstep" Vale** – quiet recon/sniper, 3 prior Catalyst runs (2 successes, 1 tactical retreat).
- Terms discussed:
  - They’re willing to go **for the chance at a Catalyst**, largely paid in **access to the Catalyst and whatever salvage they can carry**, plus reasonable supplies (~100k credits budget suggested by Maris for gear/consumables).
  - Everyone who survives and reaches the Catalyst can touch it; no artificial limit from Asha.
  - General consensus: **If a full Guardian shows up, they bail** (unless the players push hard into a risky plan like a bait-and-switch).

**Destination:**
- Using Kaelith’s **active dream scale** (galactic Catalyst map), they identified a **Dream Catalyst** in an **abandoned, primal-heavy system** (Destrian system analogue), very far from normal lanes.
- Catalyst: **Aashitak**, a Divinity **25** Dream god-corpse (see section below) – titan fragment level.

---

## Aashitak – Canon Snapshot (for GM)

**From `Places/Catalyst Aashitak.md`:**

- **Visual:**
  - A vast off‑white half-skeleton, **system-sized**, roughly the mass/scale of a couple of Jupiters.
  - Lower half of the titan is missing; the severed spine terminates in a jagged crown of **black Lacuna Shards** (void-seal crystals) that drink starlight and emit faint, wrong-colored light into an orbiting dust ring.
  - Surroundings: glinting shards, streams of crystallized dream-blood and ice drifting around the husk; bone lattices like an incomplete mega-organism.

- **Domain:** Dream (primary aspect).
- **Divinity:** 25 (greater god / titan fragment – supports massive numbers of mages).
- **Death:**
  - Slain by **Nefarious**, drained of blood, half collapsed into the Void.
  - Nefarious opened a void rift, shoved half the body through, then sealed it with the **Lacuna Shards**.

- **Magical materials:**
  - **Lacuna Shards (void-seal crystals)** – black-gleaming, warm; rift-keys and mana reservoirs for Void/Dream; stabilize or force-open small void rifts; high-capacity mana batteries; prolonged use frays the waking mind.
  - **Dreamglass (Somnium Crystal)** – crystallized dream-blood/ice droplets; store one Dream spell/vision, leak prophetic fragments; crushed = delayed dream-charge.
  - **Nightmarrow Resin** – sticky black resin in corpse hollows; used as sealant for dream-artifice, cores for Nightmare traps; imbues constructs with fear-feeding effects.

- **Guardian:** **The Half-Slumbering** (Somnist Wyrm)
  - Colossal wyrm of Entropic Bone + living dream-matter.
  - Coils through the husk’s orbit and between Lacuna Shards, especially near the severed spine/wound.
  - Semi-sentient, quasi-deific for this area; enforces the domain: lures intruders into manipulable dreams, converts them into servitors, or buries them in deep sleep.
  - Commands legions of dream-wisps, night-phantoms, bone constructs.

- **Dominant primals:**
  - **Primary:** Dream-primals – wisps, phantasmal predators (Nightmares), humanoid eidolons; illusions, memory shaping, psychic attack.
  - **Secondary:** Void-primals – rift-spectres, shard-beasts clustered around Lacuna Shards / exposed void-flesh.
  - **Tertiary:** Bone constructs/husk sentinels from Entropic Bone + Nightmarrow.

- **Catalyst boon (future, not yet):**
  - If they survive to the **nerve column of the spine**, Aashitak grants **Essence Sight** (see flows of magic; usable while concentrated, unlimited uses).

> Note: In actual play, Session 4 *did* reach the nerve column and triggered Catalyzation + Essence Sight.

---

## Session 4: What actually happened (high level)

### Umbral transit and arrival
- Asha’s corvette and Black Trace formed up and performed Umbral transit successfully.
- They dropped into the Aashitak system and approached the husk using cover and low emissions.

### Insertion into the husk
- The approach used a moving asteroid as cover; the ships slipped in via an eye socket and into the open mouth.
- Local Dream-primals (wisps/eidolons/nightmares) interfered with sensors and navigation.
- Both ships set down in a relatively sheltered valley within the jaw and deployed Black Trace on foot.

### Ground movement and the dream trap
- The team moved toward the broken spine and nerve column under patrol pressure.
- A widespread dreamfield trap separated and disoriented combatants (pocket “jungle” hallucinations).
- Kaelith used Piercing Gaze to snap back to reality and identify the “tripwire” pattern.
- Kaelith’s armor flight capability became decisive (rapid extraction/relocation of Asha and Lysa).

### Catalyst contact and catalyzation
- The party reached the nerve column of the spine and experienced a direct Dream/Catalyst immersion.
- Asha and Kaelith gained Dream catalyzation and Essence Sight.

### Guardian escalation and massacre
- The Half-Slumbering (Guardian) focused attention; Black Trace suffered catastrophic casualties.
- Mudcat was confirmed dead in-session; Rho and Tamsin survived but were heavily pressured in retreat.
- The Guardian pinned/crushed Asha’s ship at the climax.

### Kaelith’s armor reveal (cliffhanger)
- Kaelith’s armor activated a large-area siphon/weapon system that latched onto hundreds of primals.
- Kaelith chose to fire the resulting beam into open space; consequences resolve next session.

---

## End-of-session state (start-of-Session-5 setup)
- **Known survivors**: Asha, Kaelith, Lysa, Rho, Tamsin (Mudcat dead; most Black Trace killed).
- **Location**: within/near the jaw valley staging area, under Guardian pressure.
- **Asha’s ship**: crushed/pinned (cargo had been unloaded earlier in the campaign).
- **Kaelith’s armor**: charged and recently discharged; exact fallout TBD (Session 5).
- **Catalyzation**: Asha and Kaelith have Dream magic and Essence Sight available via concentration.

## Open questions to resolve in Session 5
- What did the beam hit / do, and what did it cost Kaelith?
- How does the Guardian react now that its control net was disturbed?
- How does the party extract / survive without Asha’s ship?

The area around Aashitak is best thought of as **nested zones**:

1. **Zone 0 – Arrival: Planet Shadow → Belt Edge**  
2. **Zone 1 – Outer Belt & Quiet Approach** (safe corridor)  
3. **Zone 2 – Debris Halo & Rib Anchorage** (their landing/staging area)  
4. **Zone 3 – Inner Husk & Crown Region** (high risk, where the Guardian truly lives/acts)

We only need to **fully play Zones 0–2** this session.

---

### Zone 0 – Arrival (Planet’s Umbral Shadow & Belt Edge)

**Spatial setup:**
- They drop out of the Umbral Depths into realspace **in the umbral shadow of a cold, airless planet**, only a few hundred thousand km sunward of a **wide asteroid belt**.
- Planet is quiet, with minimal installations if any; main interest is its shadow cone, which makes a safe, stealthy re-entry point into realspace.

**Asteroid belt characteristics:**
- Very wide, with **large, km-scale asteroids** and lots of empty space between them.
- Asha’s corvette and Black Trace’s ship can **move nimbly through the belt** and use rocks as cover.
- At the nearest edge: mostly **"normal" belt**, with only faint background weirdness—low-level dream noise on sensors, an occasional wisplike echo far off.

**Use in play:**
- **Scene 2 starts here.**
- They re-enter in the shadow, see:
  - Belt arcs across space.
  - Planet behind them.
  - No visible sign of Aashitak yet—still too far + occluded by belt/angle.
- Sensors can pick up a **subtle anomaly deeper in the belt**:
  - Slight variation in trajectory of some rocks.
  - Faint, persistent dream-echo background.
  - A vague "mass shadow" inconsistent with just asteroids.
- This gives them a **clear insertion vector**: thread into the belt toward that anomaly, with lots of cover and no immediate combat.

**Primals in Zone 0:**
- Very sparse.
- A few scattered **dream wisps** or tiny eidolons at extreme range.
- Function: atmosphere only; don’t attack unless players go out of their way to provoke.

---

### Zone 1 – Outer Belt & Quiet Approach

**Spatial idea:**
- As they move inward through the belt, density of rock increases **slightly**, but still navigable.
- They’re now several hundred thousand km closer to the anomaly.
- At certain angles, long-range scans begin to catch hints of **something enormous occluding background stars**, but dust and rock still conceal details.

**Why it’s "quiet":**
- This belt region is somewhat shielded from the worst of Aashitak’s dreamfields by rock density and relative geometry; think **a flank where the primals are less dense**.
- The Half-Slumbering rarely projects its full presence out here; mostly low-tier primals scouting or scavenging.

**Primals here:**
- Occasional **dream wisps**.
- Minor **bone shards** animated enough to drift oddly, but not aggressive unless disturbed.
- A small predatory pack (Nightmare-style) could be spotted at a distance as a **future threat preview**, but they don’t engage yet.

**Use in play:**
- Still part of **Scene 2
- Good place for:
  - Ship-to-ship coordination moments (Asha vs Rho piloting banter).
  - Kaelith + Lysa using basic magic to **mask their "psychic wake"** or try to read better routes.
  - Low-stakes checks: navigation, sensor use, perception to notice primordial signs.
- The **"clean entrance" corridor** is basically a channel through this quieter flank of the belt that leads toward where Aashitak’s ribs are partially embedded.

---

### Zone 2 – Debris Halo & Rib Anchorage (End-of-Session Objective)

This is the main **Session 4 destination**: getting both ships onto/into a sheltered spot on or near Aashitak without immediately triggering the full Guardian.

**Position of Aashitak relative to the belt:**
- The **upper torso and ribs** of Aashitak lie partially embedded in the inner belt.
- The **severed spine and Lacuna Shard crown** hang a bit starward of the densest belt material, surrounded by a **torus of debris and Dreamglass**.
- Ribs arc out for millions of kilometers like colossal white bridges; some are fused with asteroids.

**Debris halo:**
- Closer in, rocks gradually give way to more **bone fragments, Dreamglass clusters, and shard fields**.
- There is a **halo region** around the Lacuna crown with:
  - Drifting **Lacuna Shards** (dangerous to approach directly).
  - Patches of **Dreamglass** that glitter and softly glow in strange colors.
  - Streams of crystallized blood/ice forming slow rings.

**The Guardian’s slumbering region:**
- The **Half-Slumbering** primarily coils:
  - Around the **severed spine and Lacuna crown**, within/just beyond the debris torus.
  - It uses the shard ring as anchor points.
- When largely dormant, it:
  - Moves slowly in titanic, nearly undetectable shifts.
  - Projects a **broad dreamfield** that shapes primals and drifts, but doesn’t yet "focus" on intruders in the outer regions.
- Only **major disturbances** close to the crown / nerve column (Zone 3) or overt large-scale magic/violence wake it fully.

**Rib Anchorage – their landing zone:**
- On one flank of Aashitak, **away from the primary shard crown**, a set of **ribs scoop out a canyon-like space**:
  - Imagine two massive ribs forming a **bony canyon** open to space, partially filled with dust and a few mid-sized asteroids welded to bone.
  - Inside, there are **overhangs and hollows** where a corvette-sized ship can tuck in and **power down under cover**.
- This anchorage is **a bit off the main dreamfield currents**, so:
  - Ambient weirdness: mild dream echoes, occasional faint whispers, odd lighting.
  - Primals: a few drifting bone-construct sentries and low-level dream-wisps.
  - But **no direct Guardian line-of-sight** unless they cause a huge disturbance.

**Local primals:**
- **Default population:**
  - Scattered **bone sentinels** clinging to ribs.
  - Packs of small **Nightmare predators** hunting in 3D through the canyon.
  - A few **void-touched shard-beasts** near any smaller Lacuna fragments.
- **Use in play:**
  - On a clean approach, this is **either a stealth section** (avoid/disable a sentinel quietly) or a **single quick skirmish** as they claim the spot.
  - This is where the "it will get messy quick" can **start**, but not explode into a full Guardian fight yet.

**Session 4 end state:**
- Both ships:
  - Have navigated the belt.
  - Have seen Aashitak fully for the first time.
  - Are now **latched into this Rib Anchorage** (or a very close analog like a hollow asteroid fused to a rib) with:
    - External power down.
    - Internal lights and life support low.
- PCs **ready to board and step onto dead-god bone** at the start of Session 5.

---

## Zone 3 – Inner Husk & Crown Region (Future Sessions)

_Not used fully in Session 4, but good to have in mind so you foreshadow correctly._

**Geometry:**
- From the Rib Anchorage, tunnels, canyons, and broken marrow channels lead inward toward:
  - The **glowing nerve column** in the spine.
  - The **Lacuna Shard crown** sealing the wound.
- Inner surfaces lined with:
  - **Nightmarrow Resin** slicks.
  - Fused **Dreamglass** veins.
  - Occasional embedded **Lacuna splinters**.

**Escalation:**
- Primals become more numerous and organized the deeper they go:
  - Scouts → packs → organized bone posts tied to a **shared dreamfield network**.
- Heavy magic, noise, or time spent here raises an **"Attention Clock"** that eventually wakes or directs **The Half-Slumbering**.
- This is where genuine **zone-wide dream effects** begin: mass hallucinations, time slippage, shared visions, etc.

For Session 4, just **hint** that everything is denser and stranger deeper in (e.g., from long-range scans, glimpses down tunnels, or Lysa/Kaelith’s impressions). Don’t fully activate it yet.

## Scene Structure for Session 4

### Scene 1 – Two-Ship Umbral Transit (Reaction with Light Complication)

**Goal:** Get from New Texas to the arrival system cleanly, establish how the two ships work together, and show the Umbral Depths are dangerous but not specifically tied to Aashitak.

**Beats:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Asha pilots the corvette into a planet’s umbral shadow.
   - Rho’s ship (specify model later) forms up; decide whether they:
     - Ride tandem (each opens their own rift coordinated by Lysa/Kaelith), or
     - Use Asha’s matrix as primary and tether the second ship in formation.
2. **Magic/nav checks:**
   - Kaelith (and optionally Lysa) roll **Spellcasting + relevant void/nav aspect** using the **generic Catalyst map** scale as a focus, not Aashitak directly.
   - On success: 4–6 hour transit, minimal turbulence.
   - On partial: one bout of **Umbral turbulence** queuing a Piloting check for both ships.
   - On failure: extra stress on hull/drive, minor system penalties or short-term conditions (e.g., flickering comm band, navigation drift).
3. **Complication:**
   - A short **"Umbral squall"**: strange motion in the dark, sensor ghosts, forcing Asha and/or Rho to make a Piloting test to avoid a dangerous rift eddy.
   - No Aashitak-specific visions; only generic Depth weirdness.
4. **RP time:**
   - Bridges and comms open for:
     - Tactical planning for the approach.
     - Kaelith/Lysa philosophical sparring about Dream/void.
     - Asha/Rho logistics talk (who leads, what triggers a retreat, etc.).
5. **Exit:**
   - They follow the heading and pop out **in the planet’s shadow**, at Zone 0.

**End condition:** Scene ends with **realspace re-entry**, view of planet + belt, and first hint of anomalies deeper in.

---

### Scene 2 – First Sight & Approach to Rib Anchorage (Action)

**Goal:** Reveal Aashitak visually and maneuver through belt/debris to the Rib Anchorage with at most one quick combat/stealth encounter.

**Beats:**
1. **Initial approach (Zone 0 → Zone 1):**
   - Asha/Rho pilot through the belt toward the anomaly.
   - Use asteroids as cover; show off their skill.
   - Low-stakes sensor checks reveal increasing dream noise and weird rock patterns.
2. **Reveal (transition into Zone 2):**
   - At a certain range/angle, dust clears enough that the **system-sized off-white skeleton** of Aashitak becomes visible over the belt horizon.
   - Read a tight version of your Aashitak description from the place file.
   - Everyone gets a moment to react (awe, fear, greed, religious awe, etc.).
3. **Navigational challenge:**
   - They must pick a course to the **Rib Anchorage flank**:
     - Safer but indirect route along quieter flank (fewer primals, more time = small chance of random encounter).
     - Riskier short-cut closer to minor shard fields (higher chance of a bigger, but still localized, fight).
   - Piloting + sensor checks set difficulty; failures can:
     - Cause a collision with debris (light hull damage).
     - Stir up a pack of lesser primals.
4. **First contact (optional skirmish or stealth test):**
   - Near the anchorage, they encounter **either**:
     - A small bone-sentinel post they can try to bypass/disable quietly, or
     - A hunting pack of Nightmares/drifting bone shards.
   - Keep the fight **fast** (1–2 initiative passes) and localized.
   - No Guardian involvement yet.
5. **Docking:**
   - Both ships slide under rib overhangs/into hollowed rock fused with bone.
   - Power down main systems, leaving only minimal life support and internal lights.
   - Exterior camera shot: their ships look tiny against Aashitak’s rib structures.

**End condition:**
- Session ends as **airlocks cycle** and the PCs are about to set boots on Aashitak’s bone or step into an attached cavern leading inward.
- No direct messages, visions, or boons from Aashitak yet—only the quiet, oppressive sense of being watched.

---

## Attention / Escalation Notes (For Later)

Not critical for Session 4, but you can already track:

- **Attention Clock:** 4–6 segment track for the Half-Slumbering’s focused attention.
  - Segments tick up from:
    - Heavy spell use near crown/nerve column.
    - Destroying significant bone-constructs.
    - Prolonged noisy combat.
    - Using Lacuna Shards recklessly.
- At low attention:
  - Only local primals react.
- At mid attention:
  - Subtle dream distortions start affecting the whole husk.
- At full attention:
  - The Guardian actively hunts / reshapes the dreamfield around them.

For Session 4, you may **start the clock at 0 or 1** just from their mere arrival in the system, but don’t cash it in yet; it’s only there so that later, their choices in the approach feel like they always mattered.
