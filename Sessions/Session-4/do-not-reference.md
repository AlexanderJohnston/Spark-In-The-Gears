# SESSION 4 PLANNING: UMBRAL JOURNEY TO AASHITAK
## *Target Duration: 30 minutes of actual travel scenes*

---

## RECAP & CURRENT STATE
- **Asha** and **Kaelith** have 600+ million credits incoming from cargo sales
- **Black Trace crew** (Rho, Mudcat, Lysa, Tamsin) recruited for catalyst run
- **Two ships confirmed**: Asha's Inuran corvette + Black Trace's vessel
- **Destination**: Aashitak (Dream Catalyst, Divinity 25, in Destrian system)
- **Critical note**: Dragon scale map is confidential; presenting as "reliable intel"

---

## 30-MINUTE JOURNEY BREAKDOWN

### SCENE 1: DEPARTURE (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Establish crew dynamics + foreshadow dangers

- Both ships dock at Lone Star; crews board and conduct final comms checks
- Kaelith pilots Asha's corvette through void rupture into **Umbral Depths**
- Brief moment of disorientation—Umbral Depths are hostile; no major spell-casting permitted
- **Lysa & Kaelith exchange tactical talk** about Dream magic in the Depths (character moment)
- Set heading via flame-reading; four to five-hour transit time

**Tension point**: A momentary sensor ping suggests *something* nearby in the Depths—nothing conclusive, but unsettling

---

### SCENE 2: MID-TRANSIT / CREW MOMENT (8-10 minutes)
**Goal**: Build camaraderie, establish personalities under stress

- Kaelith & Lysa deep-dive on **Dream/Void theory** while maintaining void navigation
- Asha briefs Rho on the Dream Catalyst's nature without exposing the map
- **Tamsin does a weapons check** with her team; quiet competence
- **Mudcat tinkers** with backup systems—casual foreshadowing of what they'll need
- Tension: Minor **technical glitch on Black Trace's ship** (Mudcat fixes it in seconds, but reminds everyone how fragile this op is)

**RP Opportunity**: Lysa pushes Kaelith on *what he really hopes to find* at Aashitak (personal stakes)

---

### SCENE 3: CATALYST EMERGENCE / FIRST LOOK (8-10 minutes)
**Goal**: Visceral introduction to Aashitak; prepare for combat/exploration transition

- Second void rupture opens; ships exit into **Destrian system**
- **Immediate visual**: As per Catalyst description—
  - Off-white skeleton hanging in dark, half-body frozen mid-fall
  - Ragged spine wrapped in black-gleaming void crystals
  - Orbiting shards of crystallized dream-blood & ice
  - Slow streams of wisplike currents; shadowy predators; bone-lattice constructs moving in sync
  - Sensors go haywire; navigation systems flicker

- **Rho takes tactical command**; both crews suit up for EVA/combat
- First **encounter**: 2-3 **Dream-wisps** or minor **bone-sentinels** probing the ships at distance
  - Not aggressive yet, but *watching*
  - Lysa identifies them as Catalyst guardians' scouts
  - **The Half-Slumbering** is aware of their presence now

**Reaction moment**: Kaelith feels the *pressure* of the Dream Catalyst—something between awe and dread

---

## KEY PACING NOTES
- **Minutes 0-5**: Void transit in progress (Kaelith narrates navigation)
- **Minutes 5-13**: Umbral travel roleplay / crew moments
- **Minutes 13-18**: Void rupture, emergence, Catalyst reveal
- **Minutes 18-30**: First primal contact, decision on approach (docking/landing vectors)

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER (Session 5+)
Once they reach the Catalyst, the party must:
1. Navigate the **orbital debris field** (hazard navigation or combat)
2. Decide on **approach vector** (distraction vs. direct, per Rho's earlier suggestion)
3. Encounter **The Half-Slumbering's defenses** more directly
4. Reach the **nerve column** to receive **Essence Sight** power
5. Confront whatever remains of **Aashitak's will** (or Nefarious' echo)

---

## STAT REMINDERS FOR COMBAT
- **Dream-primals**: Illusion, memory-shaping, psychic attack
- **Void-primals**: Rift manipulation, entropy, corrosion
- **Bone-constructs**: Physical anchors, melee threats, can't be reasoned with
- **Guardian (Half-Slumbering)**: Near-deific; avoid direct fight unless desperate

---

## SUGGESTED OPENING LINE FOR SESSION 4
*"The Umbral Depths swallow light. This is the second time Kaelith has torn reality open—and this time, he's not running from Ternus docks, he's running toward something that's been calling to him through a dragon scale since the first moment he touched it. Both ships slip through the rift and into a darkness that tastes wrong. Navigation systems scream warnings. And very, very far away, something with too many eyes turns to look in your direction."*

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR GM

### Environmental Hazards in the Umbral Depths
- **Sensory Distortion**: Crews may lose track of time; 4-5 hours can feel like 2 or 8
- **Void Static**: Comms between ships flicker intermittently (forces brief isolation scenes)
- **Dream Leakage**: Fleeting visions or whispers from the Catalyst, reaching backwards through space
- **Predators**: Nothing engages yet, but silhouettes pass the viewport occasionally

### Character Development Hooks
- **Kaelith**: The closer they get, the more he *feels* the Catalyst's presence—is it calling? Or is he projecting?
- **Lysa**: She's been to Catalysts before; watching Kaelith's reaction to a new one may trigger memory of her last failure
- **Asha**: First-timer nerves; Rho's calm competence should reassure her
- **Tamsin**: Silent preparation; speaks only necessity
- **Rho**: Captain's authority is now *real*; this crew defers to him in void

### Dialogue Opportunities
- Lysa asks Kaelith: *"Are you hearing it, or are you just feeling it?"* (blurs the line between void/dream sensing)
- Asha to Rho: *"How many didn't come back from the ones you walked out of?"*
- Mudcat (drunk or pretending): *"So what's the worst thing that can happen out here?"* (Rho doesn't answer)
- Tamsin, quietly: *"Keep your hands loose and your feet moving."*

### Combat Prep Checklist
- Make sure all players know their initiative order
- Pre-roll primal stats if you want quick combats
- Establish clear communication protocol for in-void combat (no shields, no light, only suit comms)
- Clarify: Can mages cast offensive spells in the Umbral Depths? (Answer: Risky; draws attention from worse things)
