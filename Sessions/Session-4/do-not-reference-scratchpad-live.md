  Asha, the eight‑odd hours between deal and departure vanish in pieces: a hot shower that never quite washes the station smoke out of your hair, four hours of dead sleep in your bunk with the ship's hum like a heartbeat under your ribs, then lukewarm coffee and checklists. Systems lights march down your boards in orderly green: spell drive idle‑ready, spell cannon slaved to the matrix, armor and weapons stowed exactly where your hands will want them when things go wrong. By the time Lone Star's chrono rolls over to departure slot, your fretting over every readout has settled into something harder and simpler. This is as ready as she gets.

   Kaelith's hours blur with the quieter commerce of war: a narrow, overbright station shop where a bored clerk slides cases of mana beer and neatly labeled counterspell vials across the counter; a brief, practical meeting with Rho's quartermaster to sync long‑range squad comm bands so Black Trace and Asha's corvette can talk without the station listening in. Sleep comes in a few shallow hours on the bunk they've given you, spell armor standing in the corner like a silent, waiting animal, its HUD faintly pulsing as you nudge at its systems and learn its hungers; by the time you're back on the bridge, helmet sealed, it feels less like borrowed relic and more like an extension of your own intent.
   
  Lone Star Station peels away in layers. First it is all close metal and glare, gantries and floodlights sliding past the viewports as tugs shove your corvette clear of the docks; then the big shapes fall back, destroyer hulls and half-built cruisers and the slow wheel of the civilian ring turning into a band of gray against the stars. New Texas itself shrinks on the aft display, a blue-green coin under a mesh of defense grids, until it is just another bright circle in the dark and the only thing ahead of you is black. 
  
  Rho's ship settles off your starboard quarter, running lights turned down, a squat working shape with too many guns and engines to be anything but serious.
  
  His voice comes over the shared tac-net steady and dry: "Black Trace on your wing, Morrow. You call the jump, we follow." Out past both hulls the local
   star burns cold and white, and your nav overlay draws a long, tapering cone of shadow where a dead planet eats the light: the umbral well you are about to
   dive into so nobody sees you leave the map.
 
Narrator: The Umbral folds around both ships like deep water, the crack of entry already a memory behind you as Kaelith's sigils hold the route steady and the local star becomes a distant pressure somewhere you cannot see, just slow rivers of color and the sense of something vast moving far off while your boards report a clean, quiet 4-to-6 hour translation toward the system where Aashitak waits.

Narrator: Asha, on the bridge with most of the ship running dark and the only real light coming from your consoles and the faint glow of the spell-matrix, there is suddenly nothing urgent to push buttons for and a whole lot of time to sit with the fact that you pointed your livelihood at a dead god; what does that look like in her body language, and what is the first thing she says to Kaelith now that it is just the two of you and the void on your side of the comms?

Narrator: Kaelith, the spell is holding almost too cleanly under your hands, the dream scale a cool, constant weight in your awareness and the Umbral currents slipping past like wind over glass, so you have attention to spare for the way Asha rides this silence and for the flavor of the path you chose (does this corridor "feel" like Dream yet, or is it still just Void to you); pick up on something about her or the route and answer her, or if she stays quiet, be the one to break the silence with whatever question or observation he has been sitting on since you agreed to chase this Catalyst together.

Narrator:  
Realspace slams back in like a held breath, and for a long second the only thing in the viewports is black, honest vacuum, not the infinite abyss of the Umbral Depths. Then the stars resolve and the shadow fills in around you: a cold, airless planet hanging below like a dark coin, its night side swallowing starlight, and beyond it a wide band of stone and ice arcing across the system, an asteroid belt so broad it looks like someone hammered a scar through the sky. Your corvette and Black Trace’s ship drift together inside the planet’s umbral cone, drives idling low; HUDs bloom with fresh sensor returns, static still crackling from the jump, while somewhere out there, deeper in the belt, something tugs at trajectories just enough to register as wrong—rocks drifting a half‑degree off expected, a faint smear of dream-noise in the background band like someone whispering through the static.  

For now, Aashitak is only a math problem and a shadow on long-range scans: a subtle mass deficit where nothing should be, a region where sensor pings come back blurred, light curves a hair too far, and the belt thickens into a vague, occluded knot. Rho’s ship rides a few klicks off your port bow, running dark except for minimal running lights; their tight-beam hails cut through on a clean encrypted channel as the crews start trading readings, plotting insertion vectors, and arguing—quietly—over whether to take the wide, quiet flank through the safer rocks or cut closer to the anomaly and shave time at the cost of drifting nearer to whatever’s warping the field. The Depths are behind you, the Catalyst’s system ahead, and in the narrow calm between the two you get one brief chance to decide how loudly you’re going to knock on a dead god’s door.  

Next steps / plan for Scene 2:  
1. **Stabilize and Survey (Zone 0):**  
   - Let both ships run post-jump checks (hull, drive, spell matrices); quick RP over comms as they compare sensor readings.  
   - Call for basic **Navigation/Sensors/Spellcraft** rolls to:  
     - Confirm they’re in the planet’s umbral shadow and effectively stealthy from most long-range eyes.  
     - Spot the **anomalous region** deeper in the belt (mass shadow + dream-noise), giving them a clear “there’s something big that way” vector.  

2. **Pick an Approach Vector (Player Choice):**  
   - Present **two primary courses** into the belt toward the anomaly / future Rib Anchorage:  
     - **Flank Route (safer, slower):** Along the quieter side of the belt; lower immediate primal risk, more time exposed (small chance of a minor random encounter, more time for RP and planning).  
     - **Shortcut Route (riskier, faster):** Clips closer to shard fields and odd trajectories; higher chance of waking a small cluster of primals or triggering debris hazards.  
   - Anchor this in **Piloting + Sensors** tests from Asha and Rho (with Kaelith/Lysa assisting magically if they want to mask their “psychic wake” or read the currents).  

3. **Threading the Belt (Zone 0 → Zone 1):**  
   - Run a short skill challenge of **2–3 checks**:  
     - Piloting to dodge drifting kilometer-scale rocks and weird gravitational eddies.  
     - Sensors/Perception to notice low-tier primals at the edge of range (dream wisps, tiny eidolons) and strange rock patterns.  
     - Optional Void/Dream magic checks to read or dampen the local dreamfield.  
   - On **success/partials**, keep things tense but non-lethal: scraping paint, light hull stress, maybe a glimpse of distant Nightmare predators that don’t yet engage.  
   - On **failure**, hit them with:  
     - A minor collision (armor / superficial damage, nothing session-derailing).  
     - Stirring a small cluster of low-level primals that **shadow** them but don’t yet attack, foreshadowing Zone 2.  

4. **First Hints of Aashitak (Approach to Zone 2):**  
   - As they move inward, gradually let:  
     - Stars start vanishing behind an **indistinct, off-white occlusion** at long range.  
     - Sensor returns get noisier with **Dream static** and odd reflections.  
   - End this beat with a **threshold moment**:  
     - One maneuver brings them over a line of dense dust/rock and, at the right angle, they see the beginning of that system-sized bone silhouette on the horizon—but **don’t do the full corpse reveal yet**.  
   - Give each PC a brief reaction beat (internal monologue, quiet comment, awe/fear/greed) as they realize they’re heading toward something too big to make sense of.  

5. **Set Up the Next Segment (Into Zone 2 → Toward Rib Anchorage):**  
   - Close the Scene 2 “entry” on a concrete tactical decision:  
     - Both ships committing to their chosen lane toward the **Rib Anchorage flank** identified in prep, running dark, drives low.  
   - Flag for the players what’s coming next:  
     - Tighter navigation between debris and bone.  
     - Possible small encounter (bone sentinel / Nightmare pack) to secure the anchorage.  
     - The **full first sight** of Aashitak’s corpse as they break the last line of rock—saved for the next narrative beat.
Narrator:  
From the safety of the umbral shadow, Aashitak is first a subtraction more than an object: a vast, starless wound torn through the belt where light should be. As the ships creep along their chosen vector and dust thins, the shape resolves by degrees. Pale arcs of impossible bone surfacing over the horizon of rock, ribs the length of continents half-buried in drifting stone, and far beyond them the jagged terminus of a colossal spine hanging in open space, wrapped in a crooked crown of black shards that drink the starlight clean and bleed it back as sickly, wrong-colored glows into a halo of dust and crystallized dream-blood.  

Even at this range the scale refuses to make sense: the off-white lattice of its upper torso hangs across half the sky, closer stars vanishing behind it as if someone laid a bleached skeleton the size of multiple worlds on top of the constellations, while slow streams of frozen red-gold and glassy fragments glint around it like a tilted ring system. Sensors whisper of mass that doesn’t add up, of trajectories bent by something that should be dead and still but very clearly isn’t, and in the quiet of the umbral cone the whole thing feels less like a corpse and more like the fossilized moment of a god still in the middle of dying.

GM Notes – Hard Burn Piloting Beats (2025-12-10T00:32Z)

1. **Asteroid / Bone-Hazard Burn (Approach Through the Belt Toward the Skull/Throat)**  
   - **Fiction:** Engines flare, the corvette knifes out of the “safe lane” and into denser debris: kilometer‑scale rock studded with **Dreamglass** veins and jagged ribs of off‑white bone sheared off Aashitak and frozen into the belt. As you punch the throttle to get to the mouth faster, one of those fused rock‑and‑bone masses tumbles across your projected path, shedding a glittering cloud of Dreamglass shards and smaller stone; the only way through in time is to roll the ship and thread a narrowing gap between a spinning rib-spur and a chunk of crystal‑studded rock.  
   - **Check:**  
     - **Primary:** Piloting (Ship Handling / Agility) vs **DT 3–4** (harder because you chose to gun it).  
     - **Optional assist:** Sensors or Kaelith/Lysa providing a quick Spellcraft ping to map trajectories (can grant +1 die or lower DT by 1 if they succeed a DT 2).  
   - **Outcomes:**  
     - **Full success:** You roll the corvette belly‑up, slide through the gap with paint shaved but no real damage; Black Trace mirrors the maneuver a heartbeat later. You come out closer to the skull’s “horizon” than planned, shaving time off the approach.  
     - **Partial (1–2 successes):**  
       - You clear the main mass, but a spray of Dreamglass and micro‑debris rakes the shields/hull: take **light hull stress** or a minor “Scored Armor” condition, and maybe nick a sensor array (small penalty to the next Sensors check).  
       - Alternatively, you clip a bone‑spur from Aashitak herself: harmless physically, but it sends a faint *ping* through the local dreamfield that will contribute +1 tick to whatever **Attention/Guardian clock** you’re tracking.  
     - **Failure (0 successes):**  
       - You slam a wing of the corvette through the debris fringe: **moderate hull damage**, maybe one non-critical system (e.g., an external turret or a dorsal sensor cluster) goes offline until repaired.  
       - The impact kicks off a bright, sharp flare of heat and magic against the corpse’s rib‑shadow—obvious to nearby primals, and one more tick on the Attention clock.  

2. **Primals in the Throat / Rib Canyons (Burning Into the Corpse)**  
   - **Fiction:** As you follow Kaelith’s vision “down the throat” toward the broken spine, the geometry tightens into canyon‑like spaces between ribs and floating bone lattices. Your drive plume and the earlier collision wake the locals: a **hunting pack of Dream‑primals** (Nightmare shapes flecked with bone masks) and a few **bone-sentinel constructs** peel off the husk, drifting in 3D to intercept the bright line of your engine wash. Instead of a stand‑up fight in the open, you try to jink and flare past them, using Aashitak’s own ribs for cover while Black Trace angles to provide covering fire.  
   - **Check:**  
     - **Primary:** Piloting (Tactical Flight / Agility) vs **DT 3** to **“shake and mask”**: use ribs, shadow, and thrust‑cutting to minimize firing opportunities for the primals and keep them off your hull.  
     - **Optional support:**  
       - Kaelith or Lysa: quick Dream/Void Spellcraft vs **DT 2–3** to disrupt the pack’s cohesion (brief illusions, void eddies) for a minor bonus.  
       - Rho/Black Trace: Gunnery vs **DT 2–3** to thin the herd; success reduces consequences on a partial Asha result.  
   - **Outcomes:**  
     - **Full success:** You ride the ribs like terrain, cutting thrust at the right moments so your plume vanishes behind bone while the primals overshoot or get chewed up by Black Trace’s guns; a few wisps cling to your wake but nothing serious, and you make it to a viable anchorage vector near the jaw/spine intact. No extra Attention increase beyond what’s already on the clock.  
     - **Partial success:**  
       - A cluster of dream‑wisps and one bone sentinel manage to close: they get a **glancing hit** (minor armor damage or a temporary “Hull Echoes with Dream” effect that might impose disadvantage / higher DT on a future Skepticism or Resolve check as their whispers seep inside).  
       - Or you avoid serious hits, but the evasive maneuvers force you to break from the ideal covert path: you end up in a slightly more exposed anchorage with a clearer line‑of‑sight to the broken spine, ticking the Attention clock up by +1 as the Half‑Slumbering’s web “notices a disturbance.”  
     - **Failure:**  
       - You misjudge a rib-shadow and cut thrust too late; the ship swings wide into a crossfire of bone shard‑bolts and psychic howls: **moderate hull damage** plus a short, nasty **shipboard dream shock** (call for a quick Skepticism/Resolve test from bridge crew; failures gain a temporary condition like “Shaken by the Wyrm’s Dream” or suffer penalties on the next few actions).  
       - The pack survives in decent numbers and now **knows your exact vector**, significantly advancing the Attention/Guardian track and guaranteeing some kind of encounter at or just after anchorage unless the crew takes pains to hide/purge their trail.  

Usage framing: “Asha, give me Piloting for the debris run (DT X)… then another Piloting test as the local primals surge up from the ribs to greet those hot engines (DT Y), with Kaelith/Rho able to assist if they jump in.”

Narrator:
The moment Kaelith pings the rock on her HUD, Asha sees it - the fat, tumbling asteroid on a near-perfect intercept for one of Aashitak's hollow eye sockets, its bulk already dragging a faint wake of dust and glittering Dreamglass behind it. She trims the corvette's burn, slides the vector over a hair's breadth, and then pours the throttle back in, nestling her ship into the asteroid"s shadow so close that the forward cameras are mostly spinning stone and the occasional flash of off white bone far ahead; to any watcher in the belt, she is just turbulence in the big rock's exhaust as the pair of them fall toward the god's face.

As the improvised cover grows into a looming wall that fills the view, she rides its motion with small, precise bursts of thrust, bleeding speed just enough that, at the last possible moment before the asteroid slams past the socket's rim, she kicks the corvette sideways and down. The hull skims the edge of Aashitak's fractured brow like a thrown blade, then drops out of the rock's shadow and into the deeper dark of the open mouth below, Asha threading the gap between two jagged teeth of bone with centimeters to spare and leaving the sacrificial asteroid to plow on ahead as the only obvious thing anyone, or anything, should have noticed.

Narrator:
The first wisps come in like fog. Their forms are pale, eel-slick strands of light that drift up from Aashitak's bones and coil around the corvette's hull, smearing across the viewports as if something on the other side of the glass is trying to remember your shape. Asha watches her boards flicker as readings multiply: false proximity alarms, phantom engine temps, a dozen contradictory nav pings that feel less like bad sensors and more like something gently pushing every number out of tune. Deep in the drive readouts, timing markers begin to stutter a fraction of a second off-beat, threatening a misfire that would kick the ship sideways into the densest part of the wisp swarm.

She has no room to kill thrust, so she flies through it. Asha's hands are light on the controls as she ignores the lying overlays and flies by the few instruments that still ring true, trimming power with quick manual overrides. Outside, the Dream-primals thicken into half-formed shapes that snap at the corvette's wake and leave trails of cold static across the hull, but Asha rides the jitter in the drive like turbulence, rolling the ship between drifting knots of light and letting the worst of it slough off against Aashitak's own bone. Each clean correction buys another kilometer deeper into the jaw and closer to the broken spine, until the worst of the interference falls away behind them and the HUD finally settles into a single, painfully honest vector toward their destination.

Narrator:
The deeper the corvette slides into Aashitak's jaw, the more the space ahead looks like an exposed landscape instead of a skull. Miles of off-white bone ridges and valleys, knotted with old fractures and frozen flesh, glazed in dream glass and puddled black globs of decayed marrow that reflect false constellations. Out on the broader planes and higher ridges she can see the movement now: humanoid eidolons walking patrol-like arcs, hound-shaped Nightmares loping on too many limbs, and loose skeins of wisps streaming between splinters of black crystals like they are following some silent weather pattern in the dreamfield. But the surface is so vast that it is easy to disappear in the small places, and Asha finally picks out a shallow valley between two fused ridges where bone has sagged and cracked into a dish-shaped hollow, a pocket of relative quiet hidden under the shadow of a jutting spur.

Assha coasts the last stretch on minimal thrust, letting the ship settle in low behind a jag of broken marrow so that from above they are just another dark gap in the godflesh, power levels dropping one by one until only life support and a thin skein of wards hum in the background. From the bridge, the view out is a tilted slice of Aashitak's skin-plain crawling with distant primals, but down here in the groove the noise of the dreamfield feels muted, like the wake of the Half-Slumbering cannot quite reach into this crack, and for the first time since they arrived the corvette feels small enough to be truly hidden.

Narrator:
Rho brings Black Trace in low and dirty, tucking his scarred gunship into the same sagging valley on the far side of Aashitaks bone ridge so that, from above, the two ships read like nothing more than a pair of shadows in a world made of scars. When his landing struts bite into fossilized marrow, the side ramp slams down and twenty mercs spill out in disciplined fireteams, armor scuffed and guns hot, fanning into a tight perimeter while Mudcat lopes off to run a quick radiation and atmosphere sweep, Lysa closes her eyes to listen for anything paying them too much attention, and Tamsin ghost-walks up the nearest rise to set a long gun where she can see both the approach to the Catalyst and anything that might come sniffing at their hides.

In under a minute the valley has a nervous order to it: two ships powered down under the jutting bone, squads kneeling in cover with helmets sealed and visors dim, Rho clapping Asha once on the shoulder as he passes to join the line, grinning like a man who has finally found the kind of trouble his company was born for.

Narrator:
The climb to the ridge is short but ugly, boots crunching over frost-stiff bone and old flesh, breath loud in helmets as something presses faintly at the edges of thought. When Asha, Rho, and the point elements of Black Trace crest the lip and go prone beside Tamsin, the view over the far side steals what is left of their idle conversation: a vast, sloping plain of Aashitak's inner jaw running down toward the broken spine, the distance between here and there a hard twenty-minute sprint even at full push in low gravity. Far ahead, the severed vertebrae rise like shattered white pillars as large as entire cities out of a slow river of crystallized pink-blood and ice, void Shards jutting from the wound in a ragged, black crown that drinks the light and leaks it back in strangely colored shadows.

Between the ridge and that impossible landmark, the plain crawls. Humanoid eidolons patrol in loose ranks along invisible lines of force, some wearing bone masks, some half-faded at the edges like they cannot quite decide to be real; packs of Nightmare hounds pace wider, circling and re-circling scent trails that never quite lead them to the valley where the ships lie hidden. Wisps stream overhead in curling ribbons, riding currents only they can feel, occasionally dipping low to brush against patches of strange resin that glisten like a purple oil in old impact craters. There are gaps: faintly quieter channels between patrol routes, shallow depressions and jagged bone ridges that sketch a broken, indirect path toward the spine, just barely wide enough for a small, fast team willing to trust in speed, shadows, and whatever cover a dead god' jaw will give them.

Narrator:
The Lacuna shard that nearly took Kaelith's head is not alone. As it finishes skidding and digs to a halt in the godflesh, a second and third black crystal the size of dropships slam into the jaw further out, each impact sending a teeth-rattling vibration through the bone and kicking up plumes of powdered bone that hang in the air like ghostly fire. For a heartbeat it looks random, like debris falling from some unseen orbit, until Kaelith's sharpened sight catches the pattern: the shards are not falling, they are being thrown.

Far above the ragged crown of Lacuna Shards that seal Aashitak's sundered spine, something impossibly vast uncoils: a wyrm of splintered bone ribs and flesh seething with pink colored light, its body threading in and out of reality as it wraps around the shard ring. Chunks of entropic bone grind against crystal with a sound like glaciers breaking, and every time one of its coils passes through the physical the air around the team thickens, colors oversaturate, and for a moment they see themselves from outside, like pieces on a board the Guardian is studying. One titanic skull, half-formed and mask-like, turns just enough that empty sockets line up with the little knot of figures by the Catalyst, and a surge of cold, focused awareness slams through the dream, pinning every mortal mind there with the crushing certainty that The Half-Slumbering is no longer content to just dream of them.
