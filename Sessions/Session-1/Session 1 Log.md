Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Hey good evening!

Asha Morrow:OOC: hello hello
Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Hey all. Good to be back together

OOC - gonna have to work on my typing speed again. LOL



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Sorry, I was staring at my notes and got distracted adding to them.

OOC: Right, let's get into it then.

OOC: Any questions before we start?

Asha Morrow:OOC: i'm good :)



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC all good



Sshado C. (GM):The system's outer asteroid belt drifts in slow, silent arcs. Among them hangs the almost imperceptible silhouette of an old Inuran stealth freighter, a war-era hull which once carried munitions and alloy crates meant for Ternus during some unknown war campaign of the past. This vessel was one of perhaps many lost to history, and this load of cargo never reached its intended front. Little of this would be known to anyone discovering it however.

Today the freighter is inert. No active defenses. No resident crew. It is derelict with faded plating, sealed compartments, and potentially valuable materials.

Kaelith is working a salvage contract to find or disable relics aboard the ship as well as provide the general protection of having a competent mage around. He is being paid well for the job and is allowed to keep anything he can carry out with him, typical but unwritten salvage rules.

Asha is in her apartment on Ternus when she receives a ping alerting her to a new contract. She has been docked for at least several days, but as long as you want. The jobs have been drying up lately for no discernible reason. Rumors aren't even clear about it, but it's almost always something related to the war.

--

Kaelith



Sshado C. (GM):--

Kaelith took this contract on short notice after a recommendation from a student he once mentored in the Resonant Veil, someone who couldn't take the job themselves and passed along "a reliable micro-crew hungry for a score." These two are competent but untested with him personally.

They arrive, floating a few dozen kilometers away from the derelict's hull. It is a matte-black slab swallowing reflected starlight, framed by slow-spinning asteroid fragments. An intact airlock ring sits half-shadowed; its panel is lifeless. Tessa holds your vessel in a steady hover, thrusters feathering micro-corrections. Joren rolls a slim plasma cutter between his fingers; a controlled ember pulses at its tip. The nearby radio channel remains silent.

Tessa “Spoke” Arden is a lean, grease-fingered pilot with a habit of counting maneuver timings under her breath; she favors clean entries, catalogued hull condition, and keeping resale value intact. Her brother Joren is broader, burn-scarred, and impatient. He sits, twirling a plasma cutter like a baton and pushing for fast action over finesse.

Tessa Arden is lean and angular, built like the ship's control yoke she rarely lets go of. Close cropped dark hair shows a faint graphite sheen under the cockpit lights. A narrow, triangular scar sits at her temple where a headset once tore skin. Her flight harness is a worn copper-tan rig layered with sewn patch straps, scuffed at hip and shoulder from countless side-load dockings. Grease-black smudges stain the pads of her fingers and she wipes them absently on a gray cloth tucked beneath her collar before touching an antique panel. Her stance says held tension and controlled restraint.

Joren Arden stands half-turned toward the scry screen, broader through the chest and shoulders, posture casual like he's leaning into a bar conversation with danger. Burn-scar tracer lines, thin amber veins, web his forearms, disappearing under heat-scarred gloves. His hair is a tousled dark nest, a few strands singed lighter near the ends. His boots are heavier salvage pattern with the carbon toes scuffed white from age. Where Tessa is tight focus, Joren is kinetic readiness.



Sshado C. (GM):------

Asha

-----

Your megablock apartment is a compact refuge. Filtered air rushes through the intake above a basic door. A neat, well-used bed sits opposite a muted holoscreen cycling trade news in translucent slate. A kettle's residual warmth clings to the small stove. A new encrypted contract pane blossoms on the holoscreen, six crescent glyph seals rotating slowly as a figureless voice speaks:

"Captain Asha. An Inuran war-era freighter drifts in your belt. I require intact tow custody before commercial phase begins. Ten standard hauls' payment. Timestamp acceptance grants temporary legal rights for you over the hull, permitting it to clear any docking permits. Will you accept?"

The glyphs lock and a set of light glass chimes fade into the deep structural thrum of the block. A narrow battery bar shows five green segments. A thin timestamp line crawls forward. The last wisp of steam vanishes and the air cools slightly. Distant elevator vibration can be felt among the groan of the city. Muffled steps can be heard out in the hallway.

Asha Morrow:Asha is a tall human captain built like a military officer that takes care of herself meticulously. Her fine black hair goes down to her shoulder with the right side shaved close. Asha's face is stern and her eyes focused, deep in thought as the holoscreen plays the message. She accepts the contract immediately and prepares to leave, grabbing her go-bag. Asha rushes through the apartment, turning everything off and heading out and soon as she is ready, suddenly feeling a deep yearning to get out into space.

Narrator: Asha:The contract accepts with a soft chime. A nav packet arrives on her device or with a clean vector to the contracted ship. It shows that is is parked in the asteroid belt between Ternus and the next planet out in the solar system.

A short message follows from the merchant, brief and polite. "Thank you, Captain. Intact tow preferred. Payment on delivery to the trade moon dock. Please store it at Ternus until negotiations are completed. I expect no more than a month."

Just like that, the bite of not negotiating the contract lands. Sure, it will pay out handsomely, but now she is going to be on the hook for all of the docking fees associated with keeping a whole other ship on dock along with her own. Either her savings will take a hit, or she will need to find something to 'salvage' from the wreck she finds before towing it.

Your hangar is quiet. Work lights stripe the floor in pale bars. A thin haze of coolant scent and warm dust meets you at the ramp. Your ship waits with belly lights on. Pre-flight comes back clean. Fuel and tow lashings are ready. The nav insert pings once more. Interference windows in the belt blink on your HUD like soft beats in a calm pulse as you examine a long range scan of the target location. It should be a straight shot, but not to anywhere that anyone would normally look. The ship seems to have been parked, or crashed into the dark side of a non-rotating asteroid among a strange cluster of many similarly sized rocks. None of them spin, the only thing setting them apart, but not strange enough to attract roaming eyes.

Asha Morrow:Asha exhales a heavy breath through her nose upon reading the acceptance message and starts considering all the uses she could have for a freighter to avoid a month of fees. Her face hardens as she mulls it over, going through pre-flight setup instinctually. Asha wastes no time and lifts off as soon as she is ready, following the provided route towards the asteroid. She examines the layout of the asteroids to familiarize herself with the destination and considers the lack of rotation on the asteroids a bad sign.

Narrator: Asha:OOC: Please roll piloting skill to exit the dock and roll again to determine your asteroid approach.

OOC: Good chance to test the char sheet



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): All good? You can describe Kaelith on your end or I can kick off with some dialogue from the NPCs

(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): my bad, reading slow and eating and dealing with people in my house

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): No problem just making sure I'm not leaving you hanging

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Eat :)



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith stares out the cockpit window at the dead freighter. "Looks like nobody's home. How you wanna go about this?"

Narrator: Asha:Dock control clears you to depart. You lift on a clean thrust and feel the ship settle into a steady climb. Lines on the HUD turn green in sequence. The bay door opens to cold stars. You nose out without drift or yaw. Traffic spacing is perfect. Your hands move through checks by habit. Engines answer with a smooth, even tone. With this takeoff you waste no time.

The vector loads and the course line reaches for the belt. Interference windows blink on your display like slow heartbeats. You time your burns to the gaps between asteroids. The ship slides into each window with light touches on the stick. The cabin is quiet apart from the hum of the drive and a soft tick from the panel when a pulse passes. Long‑range shows the target cluster as a dim knot. No beacon pings. No obvious patrol paths. It feels like a place people do not look.

You cross the boundary of the belt and match its plane. Rock slips by in slow frames. The cluster grows and resolves as a group of same‑sized bodies. None of them turn. The dark faces look carved from the same thought. Your HUD paints a careful arc around them and marks a safe lane. You trim speed and come in on a shallow approach. Not to your surprise since this is a stealth ship but there are absolutely no signs of a ship anywhere in the asteroid cluster. Not on visual scan, not on radar pings, no electromagnetic signals, nothing. Whatever the ship is, it sits on the dark side of the largest rock. In less than five minutes your braking burn will finish and you will be able to pull slowly around the rock and take a look for yourself at the freighter.

You have a little bit of time to prepare any gear or to announce your presence and intent. To anyone watching from a distance they will know not to interfere if you declare ownership over the vessel and broadcast the permits received from your contract.

Or you can always stay silent and choose to deal with that on an as-needed basis.

Tessa Arden:"I'm not in a rush. We could take our time, see if the system has juice. Drop a maintenance line into the outer hull and see if we can jumpstart it if not. Then hack the airlock open."

Joren Arden:"Naahh, I can cut through the airlock in like two minutes. Let's just suit up."

Narrator: Kaelith:They seem to both feel strongly about their option, leaving it up to you to break the tie, Kaelith. There is no clear legality laid out regarding this operation. Being quick is just as important as being careful.

Asha Morrow:Asha broadcasts her permits with no introduction and otherwise focuses on making a safe burn towards the freighter. By this point she would be wearing her body armor and her pump shotgun should always be within arms reach of her chair. Not that she expects to use either on a tow job.

Narrator:Before anyone can make a decision, Asha's ping lights up on the Crowfeather, the salvager Kaelith and the siblings are currently on.

Tessa Arden:"What the shit? Someone's here, they just announced claim on the hull."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"We need to get in and get to work before we aren't the only ones looking at this goldmine."

Tessa Arden:She pulls open the permits quickly and fans them out on the scry screen.

Joren Arden:"Too late."

"What we doin, boss? You buy me some time maybe I get in there with the mage here and we go shopping?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Son of a bitch."

Tessa Arden:"Our luck. Let's try to scare them off first."

Tessa opens the communication link and casts her face to video, keeping the frame tight to just the bridge behind her. "This is the Crowfeather, we are already engaged in legitimate salvage on this vessel. If you give us thirty minutes we can be out of your hair and the rest is yours."

Narrator:It will be two minutes before you round the asteroid at this point, Asha. You have a moment to decide what to do with the revelation that you are not the only one here. Pirates, likely.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"You call that scaring them off!"

Asha Morrow:"Negative." Asha relays, not deviating from her course.

Tessa Arden:"Fuck me," she mutters.

Tessa kills the link.

"Look, this is a stealth freighter. Old war time stuff. Whatever is in there is worth more than our lives a thousand times over. We go in and take what we can and get out before she has time to finish setting docking clamps."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Then move it."

Joren Arden:"How?"

Joren Arden crosses his arms.

Joren Arden:The man seems a bit slow.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"No, not what I meant. Let's move it and get onboard."

Tessa Arden:"Suit up."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith rushes over and begins suiting up

Narrator:OOC: Roll Athletics to get suited up and to the airlock within a minute. DC of 1

Narrator:Everyone makes it to the airlock in time with their environmental suits on. Joren has a plasma cutter and Tessa throws a backpack to Kaelith and one to Joren as soon as she sees them.

The airlock hisses and cycles as soon as everyone is visually ready and you are out in the silent, hostile void. The spacewalk, or jump, to the other ship is just fifty meters with how close you are parked. Without the asteroid or either ships moving, it was relatively simple for Tessa to get close enough.

Asha, you round the asteroid and see the Crowfeather, a tiny salvager corvette, is parked right up next to your target.

From here your screen can zoom in and see the lights on their suits, noting their spacewalk. With sufficient piloting skill you can try to bump your maneuvering thrusters to get you there before they cut into the ship.

OOC: Speaking of ships, do you know what type yours is?

Asha Morrow:OOC well it was originally a corvette but there was a small selection so the only one available is the inuran corvette and idk if that makes sense

Narrator:OOC: Okay that works. No fancy spell drive or matrices then, makes sense.

Asha Morrow:Asha will attempt the maneuver to pull in before the salvagers can cut into the ship.

Narrator:You push the thrusters to their limit but the stealth coating and passive defenses of your target make your screen a blurry mess as you get closer, forcing you to adjust and use a different point on the rock to measure your distance. You have to slow down just long enough for them to cut in, but you will be right on their tail unless they are really rushing.

Joren Arden:Joren hits the airlock first and tries to quickly pop it open with the cutter.

Joren is fast but clearly rushing too much under the pressure. He manages to get it open within a minute and you are all in. A patch kit is grabbed off the wall and used to seal the airlock behind them once they're all in.

Narrator:Your environmental suit will read low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide here since the scrubbers are not on. You will need to keep your suits on.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Gonna be harder to work with these suits on. So let's get to it."

Narrator:The freighter is long and low. About one hundred ten meters from nose to tail and a little over twenty at its widest. The matte-black hull is smooth. Edges are beveled and every surface is broken by shallow facets that soak up light. Most markings are gone. Only faint Inuran stencil bands remain near recessed hardpoints. The skin is a sensor killing coat. It looks like a shadow in a field of shadows.

Inside the airlock the metal is dry and frost dull. The inner door is stiff but workable now that the ring is open. Emergency stripes run along the deck and walls in faded gold. Inuran glyph numbers mark sections at each bulkhead. The air is stale and thin. Your suit reads low oxygen and high carbon dioxide. The gravity is near zero. Your boots magnetize when they meet deck plates. Handholds line the corridor in neat rows.

The first interior corridor runs fore and aft. To the fore sits crew space and the bridge. You can expect a mess, bunks, a small wash, and a locker row. To the aft sits cargo and engineering. The armory is aft starboard behind a reinforced door just before the engineering ring. There are two main cargo bays midship

Tessa Arden:Tessa takes point, leading them to the first corridor, but she glance back at both of them. "Split up?"

Narrator:Asha, you pull up to the ship. Are you going in as close as they are to board, or do you want to deploy docking clamps and simply yank them with it?

Their ship does not appear to be directly tethered.

Asha Morrow:Lets yank em

Narrator:Roll a DC1 engineering to get your docking clamps attached to the ship for towing.

Joren Arden:"Suppose I can check the bridge and try to get power on. Tessa, you can get Cargo? And where should the mage go?"

He bounces a bit on his toes, ready to move move move.

Narrator:A deep but quiet crash against the hull can be heard and then a brief rumbling, the sound of docking clamps being attached from the outside. This vessel is about to be towed whether they are in it or not.

Tessa Arden:"Shit, one of us has to get back to the ship. It has to be me. Joren, Kaelith, FIND SOMETHING."

She sprints back off toward the airlock.

Joren Arden:"I'm checking the manifest!" he yells, heading right for the bridge.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will head to the armory and begin working on the door_

Narrator:The armory door sits in a pocket of cold metal and faded gold stripes. It spans the corridor from deck to overhead, a slab of dark alloy with three recessed locking bars set into the frame. The seam is tight and clean. Your boots click to the deck plate when you stop in front of it. Frost dusts the lower hinge and the handle of a manual crank that folds flat against the right side.

A small lock panel is set chest high. Three sigils are arranged in a neat triangle above a narrow status strip. The top sigil glows with a soft, steady light. From the magic rolling off it you can tell it is dream, but the sigil itself is foreign to you.

Its mark looks like a closed eye with three short lashes and a faint star where the pupil would be. The glow is cool and even. The other two sigils are dead. Their channels are cut deep and filled with dull metal. One is a tight, angular shape that steps inward like a broken spiral. The other is a smooth knot that loops back on itself in a figure eight. You do not recognize either of them.

Asha, it will take you some time to navigate carefully out of the asteroid belt with the ship. Roll an initial DC 1 piloting check to get away from the main rock.

Tessa Arden:Tessa hits the outer airlock and leaps from the hull toward the Crowfeather.

Her leap is perfect and she's back on her ship in the blink of an eye. She heads for the command deck and tries to get her suit off.

Narrator:Asha is one of the best pilots around her local docks on Ternus. She pulls free from the asteroid and already has a trajectory in mind to reverse her route. This is one of the easiest jobs she has ever done, they don't even have guns to turn on her!

A minute later, the Crowfeather pops up on the scry screen for Tessa's ship. Visual sensors and instruments show it is currently at no hope of catching up.

(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Relic hunter has the decipher trait that lets them translate any launguage

Narrator:The other ship is rapidly falling away from you at this rate.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Do it, they are void and fire

Asha Morrow:Asha stays alert, watching her various screens and the data on them as she drifts farther and farther away from the salvager. She bites her lip and shakes her head ever so lightly while mumbling to herself "What are they doing?"

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): You won't recognize them but you know enough to discern their meaning at a glance. Your gut tends to be right on these things, you've seen too many languages by now and learned many.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): so I can activate the void and fire?

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Indeed

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): If you want to activate them you can feed a little magic into each



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will activate the 2 remaining sigils_

Tessa Arden:Tessa tries to reroute some power and punch the engines, taking the risk of hull damage to try and keep up with Asha's piloting through the asteroid field.

Narrator:You feed a careful thread of power into the dead marks. The angular broken spiral drinks the charge and settles into a deep, matte black that seems to pull light inward. The smooth looping knot warms to a steady ember red. Dream stays cool and pale. The status strip slides from left to right in one clean pass. Inside the frame, three locking bars withdraw with a heavy clunk. Frost cracks along the lower hinge. No pressure push follows. The seam parts without a hiss. The door slides back on stiff rails and reveals a dark room lined in faded gold stripes.

Your suit lamps catch the shapes first. Two Inuran Mark V spell armor suits stand on wall hooks, black plates with faint iridescent veins and compact thruster vanes at the shoulders and hips.

A low, sealed locker sits at arm height. The latch gives with a firm pull. Inside are two Inuran Mark III spellpistols. They look grown more than machined, with sleek organic curves of obsidian alloy veined with faint violet motes that brighten when you grip them. The spiral focusing helix at each muzzle throws a tight corkscrew of light when fired. A soft harmonic tone rides the shot for the wielder alone. Each receiver has a micro‑glyph cluster ready to sync with a linked mount if you fit one on a suit.

On the lower shelf sits a vacuum pouch with five Stims. They are clear ampoules with fine silver particulate. They are injectable medicine with painkillers and healing nano‑bots. To the side, a strapped crate holds fifty Ternus MRE bricks.

No alarms. No lights. Just cold metal, clean racks, and the gear you came for.

Narrator:Asha keeps a comfortable lead, the distance between them steadily growing as Tessa cannot keep up in the asteroid field. At least the Crowfeather hasn't been damaged.

The sensor readings on her ship show the tow is going well. The hull of this stealth freighter is incredibly strong. It's big too, more than twice the size of Asha's ship. Despite that it's showing as lighter than she would expect a freighter of its size to be. Perhaps it's empty.

Tessa Arden:Tessa opens a comm link to Kaelith, "How's it going in there? I got bad news for you two. I can't keep up. This asteroid field is killing me. Whoever is towing you is cracked out."

Joren Arden:There is no response from Joren.

Asha Morrow:Asha considers her contract and wonders if the hull of a stealth freighter alone is worth what she is being paid even if it were empty. She pushes away the thought and focuses on keeping her lead.

Narrator:The stealth coating on this hull alone is worth enough money to retire tomorrow.

Whoever hired you they are either government or extremely well connected. How they knew it was here in the first place is a mystery. And you managed to get to it just before it was stolen or worse. The timing is too convenient.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith stares at the items in fascination before speaking_ "I got some good shit in here. Get up here so we can get this outta here Tessa."

Narrator:The whole job is as weird as you might expect for an Inuran. The trade moon meant to come into this system is a big deal. The Inurans build these moons like a megacity of pure commerce, stocked with everything you could imagine. Every good, delicacy, weapon, artifact or gimmick they think they can sell. They establish a trade treaty to exist in system and plan out an orbit before expending massive amounts of magical energy to teleport into the system.

They tend to keep to themselves otherwise and their jobs are usually odd requests and a little bit in the gray area of legality.

On the surface though it checks out. A merchant would be thrilled to sell old equipment back to the system when the moon lands.

Tessa Arden:"I can't! You two need to board her or get ready to bolt when you get into the dock. But then you'd be dealing with security. I'll try to follow but soon we'll be in open space where I can't do anything about her. I can't just ram them!"

Narrator:Kaelith, as you're staring at the items you feel _something_ in the room. It must be the spell armor, but it feels smaller. Still, there is magical presence around the armor.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith will examine the source of the magic

Narrator:Tucked in a front compartment of the left suit of armor is a dragon scale pulsing a pale purple light. A dream scale. These are commonly used to encode massive amounts of information, or to power spells or magical devices, create artifacts, you name it. Information storage is the most common however.

As soon as you lean close though you feel a flash of something you can not quite place. Not fear, not repulsion, but colder. The metal alloy of this spell armor looks slick, like it is ever so slightly wet. It's cool to the touch if you retrieve the scale.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will attempt to secure the dragon scale in the event he cannot get the suits out_

Narrator:Asha, you pull out of the belt into clear space. You now are basically in the clear. If the other ship were to engage in hostilities here then it would be in plain view of everyone around Ternus.

You can taunt them or leave them hanging to your heart's content.

The dragon scale is easy to toss into his backpack. It's plausible that he could wear one of the suits and carry the other out, and stuff the spell pistols and stims in his pack.

Either that or ditch the second suit.

Asha Morrow:Asha lets go of some of the tension she was hanging onto and breathes out a heavy sigh. Her hand reaches to broadcast a message but she pulls away, thinking better of it.

Narrator:With the coordinates entered, Asha can lean back and let her ship finish the acceleration and braking burns into docking space. Then she can guide it in manually from there.

She can optionally choose to report on the contract status now.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will begin donning one of the suits with the intent of trying to get it all to the airlock_

Narrator:OOC: Does Kaelith have any experience with spell armor?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - probably only in the aspect of reclaiming and salvaging it

Asha Morrow:Asha quickly gives a full contract status report, including the salvagers still on the freighter. She sighs and reaches over to grab her pump shotgun, preparing for what could be next.

Narrator:Kaelith sketches a void sigil in front of the armor and it goes translucent, allowing him to step in. As soon as he is standing in it, the armor materializes around him with a perfect fit. The HUD display comes on and is immediately interesting. The interface uses more of that language from the armory door, unknown to Kaelith but within a few moments he deciphers it.

A minimap appears, showing his position and not much else. A ragdoll appears, showing green on all limbs for suit health. A potion loader utility shows three empty slots and the navigation system is _way_ more advanced than Kaelith has ever seen in his life. The system has its own oxygen system and it helps feed the navigational jets which are highly optimized for combat and going as fast as humanly possible.

There also appears to be an empty indicator for a shoulder mounted gunlink. You can attach a spell pistol to the hardpoint on your right shoulder and it will be driven by the on-board intelligence.

Unless you spend time exploring the armor, you arle able to scoop up all of the gear and getting to the airlock. The outer patch was removed by Tessa so there is no atmosphere, but no problem for you. There's no sign of Joren.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will snap a spell pistol into the hardpoint before scooping up the rest of the equipment and heading back towards the airlock_ "Joren! Come in man. Where are you?"

Narrator:No response.

Tessa is out of range now for short radio communication as well.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"SHIT!" _Kaelith will take a few minutes to check the bridge for Joren_

Narrator:You pull into the forward compartment and find the bridge small, dark, and suddenly not dead. Two universal magical matrices sit recessed into the deck just behind the pilot consoles: circular pads with three concentric rings suspended over each. The rings are thin, rune‑etched, and now rotating in slow, independent motion. A faint low hum rides under the movement like distant turbine blades. Soft violet and pale gray light traces the rune channels, pulsing in a staggered heartbeat sequence. Joren is slumped half across the nearer matrix pad, one knee on the ring lip, one arm dangling, helmeted head resting against the inner rotating ring. The rings drift past his shoulder without touching. His plasma cutter lies a meter away, powered down, a faint warmth still bleeding off the barrel.

Asha, you are beginning braking burn now and heading into docking space. You'll need to take manual control soon, but you can take the chance to broadcast your docking permits ahead of time and announce that you need a second bay for the towed vessel.

Asha Morrow:Asha broadcasts her permits, requests the second bay for the freighter, and requests for security to be informed of the ongoing thief situation.

Narrator:

Docking control returns an all clear for Asha's docking permit and notes that a second bay just beside hers was just cleared and should be immediately open when she pulls in.

A few moments later a follow-up ping alerts her that security is en route.

Other than your immediate problems, Kaelith, you do technically have a powered up bridge. You can cause a lot of havoc if you fire up the spelldrive, and you also have comms links you can establish with Asha.

Or Tessa

Normally Asha would know the other ship has powered up but it's stealth and the engine has not been powered on, so it looks off for all intents and purposes.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will open the comm link for all to hear._ "I have power on this puppy. Don't make me do something you'll regret."

Asha Morrow:Asha tilts her head in thought and opens comms to respond, "We're already burning into port, anything you do will risk the dock too. If you wish to be a wanted man, beyond your thieving I mean, then do what you feel."



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): would Kaelith even have the knowledge on how to fire up the engine

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): It's a spell drive, and by the look of it it's a void drive. He can slam it to full speed without even a roll.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Just head to a matrix and hit void on the navigation ring. These ones can do offense, defense, and navigation.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Piloting it though? Would require a roll

Narrator:OOC: Just remembered there are ship speed rules. Will use those next time.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I have no idea who you are Captain, but I will die and take as many people with me before i get locked up."

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Yeah, canonically you can easily take out a crap ton of security wearing Mk V armor.

Asha Morrow:Asha broadcasts to the dock and informs them of the situation, requesting any aid they can provide. She switches back to talking with the thief, "Let's see it then."

Narrator:The dock replies quickly, informing Asha that they were able to catch some Ternus marines on the dock. She'll have the backup she needs.

Narrator:The twin hulls clear the final traffic lane. Docking rings ahead glow with steady amber guidance strips. Your tow lines stay tight. The stealth freighter’s matte skin looks like a block of night against the floodlights. Asha’s ship drifts into alignment first. Autopruning thrust corrections pulse in small blue jets. The freighter slides behind on a controlled glide until both silhouettes sit over their assigned bays. They are caught by the clamps and lowered down onto their bellies.

Kaelith feels the ship settle with a groan. It hasn't sat in a bay in decades.

Joren is still out cold. Tessa is nowhere to be found on comms or nearby space.

Asha, the dock has already responded to your broadcast. Seven Ternus marines wait in a half circle just inside the pressure gate of the freighter’s bay. Combat armor is slate gray with white unit chevrons at the left shoulder. Plates are scuffed, utilitarian, no ornament. Each marine carries a kinetic slug rifle with a heavy barrel shroud and a top strip of simple iron sights plus a short micro sensor nub. No spell focuses. Rifle stocks rest against hips or low shoulders. Three kneel at the front to keep muzzles angled upward without crossing lines. Four stand behind them in a stagger you could read like a wall. Visors are down. Status lamps at each jaw hinge show solid green. Their posture is ready but not rushed.

Security control pings confirmation: bay sealed, perimeter established. A portable field scanner on a tripod tracks heat signatures at the freighter’s airlock line.

Kaelith, a comms channel opens on your bridge. The drydock master for the main Ternus dock is demanding you surrender immediately and exit the ship without weapons out.

Asha Morrow:Asha stays in her chair, running a finger along her shotgun in contemplation and quietly mumbling again "What the fuck?" her face contorts as she tries to put pieces together she doesn't yet have.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith looks for a way out of the ship other than the airlock_

Narrator:A glance through the ship's controls yields nothing obvious. Some maintenance hatches along the outer edge through engineering's ductways. A pain in the ass to get to, and would only spit you out relatively further away from the airlock.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Fuck" _Kaelith sits in the captain's chair waiting for the boarding party_

Joren Arden:Joren makes a gurgling noise.

He tries to climb to his feet suddenly, jerking up and failing at first, but then he finds grip on one of the matrix rings and it carries him upward. Kaelith has just long enough to see Joren's eyes are filled with a bright white light and a mist of magic. He doesn't seem to see Kaelith, but is looking off in the distance through the ship's hull. With a raised hand, he begins sketching sigils in the air. First a Void, then Fire, then Void again, Fire, and finally Earth, then Water, then Air. By the end it is almost too much for Kaelith to keep track of as the runes meld into each other in the air, flickering quickly.

Whatever it is, the spell is more advanced than Kaelith knew was possible.

Narrator:Security informs Asha that an escort is being sent to her ship, to power down her ship when she is ready.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Joren! Joren! What the hell are you doing?"

Asha Morrow:Asha sends one last broadcast informing her client of the current situation then powers down her ship, heading for the exit after.

Narrator:Before Asha can leave her bridge, and before Joren could respond, everything hangs for a moment. It takes too long, and the air feels strange and unnatural. A searing purple light rips through the dock on both of their external monitors and the world is suddenly upended. Both ships go spinning out into space, with Asha's ship no longer powered to report on damage. She is thrown against the bulkhead and gets a nasty bruise (no negative) or a cracked rib (+1 luck), her pick. The same goes for Kaelith, he can either take minor lacerations (no negative) or black out from the sudden g-force for thirty seconds (+1 luck).

By the time you are able to right yourselves and figure out what happened, it is obvious that section of docks are gone. Several dozen kilometers of bays were wiped out, and the damage hasn't even begun to finish rolling through the orbital station.

Your ships are shockingly intact.

Asha Morrow:Cracked rib for sure.

Narrator:OOC: Roger that, take a -1 to any athletics checks until you get it treated.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:30 second black out works

Narrator:OOC: Excellent one luck each

Kaelith you wake up with no lasting injuries, as you dropped from blood pressure changing too fast for your body to keep up with. Freighter took the majority of the hit and is not in great condition. There are hull breaches all over the side of it and the spell drive is flickering between warning and stable on the readings.

Asha, your ship seems like it was shielded partially by the freighter from whatever just attacked.

Asha Morrow:Asha takes a moment to recover from the impact and then reorients herself, gritting through the pain of whatever injury she now has to then approach her chair and being powering up ship back up.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:After getting to his feet, Kaelith will look for Joren

Narrator:Asha's ship powers up and performs diagnostics. The long range comms equipment is damaged and needs repair. Short range radio works up to a few hundred kilometers. Some maneuvering thrusters are out but the system can compensate with what is left. Lots of cosmetic damage, but no breaches.

Nearby scan shows debris _everywhere_, but among them is the freighter, spinning freely.

Joren is found on the ground against the wall, tossed by the explosion. His eyes are burned out of his skull and he looks frail, as if drained of life.

A quick check will reveal he is dead.

Asha Morrow:Asha sends out a short range broadcast for the dock, hoping they receive, and gives a full report of the current situation giving specific detail to the now spinning freighter that needs to be corrected. She maneuvers her ship away from the freighter while trying to avoid any other heavy debris.

Narrator:Short range radio is completely jammed up. Asha makes her call outs but doesn't hear any obvious acknowledgement. It's difficult to tell if she's getting through, as at least a dozen other people are trying to use the same channel. After several frustrating tries, she thinks she hears that she needs to guide herself in manual.

At the same time it sounds like she should stay away. The dock is in chaos.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith will attempt to discern the damage to the freighter on the control panels if they are still powered

Asha Morrow:Asha pulls her ship away to give room to any other ships responding to the chaos and to watch from a safer distance.

Narrator:Kaelith, your comms array is still intact and you are receiving instructions given out to everyone around the dock. All ships are to head down to the main traffic lanes and be guided in. Those who are able to remain out in space for a few hours or days are asked to please do so.

OOC: Asha, let's try a Perception check DC 1

Asha Morrow:

|Asha Morrow|
|---|
|Perception|

|(4+0) Intuition  <br>(2+0) Percept(TN5)  <br>(0) Bonus Dice  <br>(0) Edge|

Narrator:You can see emergency traffic lighting being switched on at the primary lanes going into the orbital station. They're usually reserved for military traffic or priority shipments. Some ships in the area do seem to be trying to form an impromptu line.

It's a few thousand kilometers out, but nothing you need main engines for.

Asha Morrow:Asha mulls it over for awhile, considering her options, and chooses to stay put for now. With this going on if she lands she might be stuck there awhile. Instead she keeps her comms open, hoping maybe she can make some quick money helping with something up here to make up for the botched tow job.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith will attempt to slowly maneuver the freighter further out to space

Narrator:Asha, you see the stealth freighter right itself suddenly and begin maneuvering out into space using just thrusters. It's moving away from the docking rings.

Asha Morrow:Asha will approach and maneuver to attempt to reengage her tow. Maybe the hull is still worth enough to save this job.

Narrator:Asha pulls up beside the ship and attempts to engage docking clamps. The system halts before it can even begin, recognizing that the clamps on the freighter are wrecked. It's going to need to be parked manually and repaired.

Kaelith, your scry screen shows Asha's ship moving up next to yours and attempting to override your docking systems, which are not responding as they don't exist.

Asha Morrow:Asha curses and closes her eyes to search for an answer she can't find. She opens them and sends out a short range broadcast to the freighter, "You're messing with my money. We can still work this out. You can board my ship, we'll pretend you were here with me the entire time, and the thief got away or disappeared in the blast. We can both win."

Narrator:She's right, you could slave control of the ship over to her system from the bridge and board.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith opens the comms. "I can agree to that but don't think about crossing me."

Asha Morrow:"I don't have anything to gain by that. Give me control of the freighter and I have every reason to cooperate and ensure what little remains of this fucked job goes smoothly."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Turning over control now" _Kaelith hands over control of the freighter_

Asha Morrow:Asha takes control and pilots both ships to a safe distance and bring them to rest to allow for boarding.

Narrator:The ships link up nicely with the same old standard airlock link that has been used for ages. Apparently this old Inuran ship was still built to modern standard. Passage between the two is trivial then leaving both to explore freely.

There is still plenty aboard the freighter and Kaelith is lugging around most of the armory.

Upon first seeing him, panic would be a normal response. Nothing can stop a tech mage who is pissed off at you and Kaelith appears to be one.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith will head to the airlock door to await the crew from the other vessel

Narrator:His armor is _notably_ fancier than normal Ternus outfits and also looks Inuran, so it would be like seeing an alien marine.

Asha Morrow:Asha awaits in her ship on the other side of their connected airlock staring back at Kaelith with her shotgun at her hip, hand on the handle. "Howdy."

Narrator:Kaelith appears on the other side of the airlock with a second suit of armor in tow.

The visor is mirrored, so whoever he is you can't make out any features yet.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): All good? Asha's waiting for you



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:After staring a moment at Asha, Kaelith strolls over to her ship

Narrator:There are a small space for crew quarters, a kitchen, storage bays here and there, basic engineering and all of the things you'd expect any decent corvette to have. Kaelith finds himself at an intersection shortly after entering the ship, with a number of different directions he could take.

It's small here. A crew of no more than five really would be happy.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"So how's this gonna work Captain?"

Asha Morrow:"Well, I need the freighter docked up here for my contract, but you can stay with me. I can take you to the surface if you want or we can hang out up here, I have the supplies to wait. Either way, eventually security will want to inspect the freighter after what just happened. They won't find anyone, and I'll make up some bullshit about how I took control and stopped the spin."

"Oh and we'll not kill one another, that's important too."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Wherever is fine. Is the vessel what your contract is for or the contents as well?"

Narrator:The longer you spend in this armor, the more you start to pick up on, Kaelith. There's some sort of additional meter you have never seen when salvaging armor before. It's just labeled magic, and it is not obvious why. The suit feels hungry too somehow.

Suits never _feel_ like anything.

You also realize you haven't checked the suit's void storage yet.

Asha Morrow:Asha shrugs, "I don't remember anything in the contract about the contents, so if you want to keep some stuff I'm not going to care. I'll blame whatever isn't there on the people that got away."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith will start casually inspecting the suits controls and storage capabilities_

"We could head back over while we wait and see what else might be there."

Narrator:Kaelith sketches a void rune in the air in the middle of the conversation and opens a void pocket, pulling out a long spellsword etched in old runes. The metal is some unknown black alloy.

It's less that he chose to and more that he willed the suit's storage to work and it moved with the intent.

Asha Morrow:"Yeah, I figure I might as well grab a couple items while I'm in this ridiculous situation."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Let's go check it out then."

Narrator:Back on the other ship, there are still options. Cargo, the armory, the bridge, crew quarters, engineering.

Asha Morrow:Asha will head over to the freighter with Kaelith and start looking for anything notable that would either be useful to her or look valuable.

To the cargo, I suppose.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Cargo works

Narrator:Cargo is in good shape. A minor amount of material and tools were thrown around but everything stayed bolted down and secure. Each of the crates is high tech with an individual manifest on the side. Their contents are high grade ammunition for large battleships, enough spell armor for a small platoon of tech mages, spellrifles and pistols, and medical supplies. A small treasure trove of war supplies are here. One of the crates has an entire spare kit of stealth coating for a ship. Another crate near it has a few dozen blank dragon scales on the list, all dream.

All of it is ridiculous. A dragon scale is so much money.

Asha Morrow:By the end of reviewing the contents of the cargo Asha is rubbing her forehead with her hand, "What the fuck is going on? What is this? Who are you? Did you know about this?"

Narrator:The room feels colder and quieter than it should. Perhaps the reality of what you are standing in is becoming more real. This is a major supply vessel for a war effort. An old war. It shouldn't even exist, let alone be in your hands.

For all you know, the munitions are all warheads.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I hope you're making a killing on this haul. My suggestion is at least taking the dragon scales."

Asha Morrow:"Are you out of your mind? We're taking all of this and getting the fuck out of here."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Now your talking"

Asha Morrow:"Look around you, this isn't just life-changing, this is a _fortune_. We need to start loading as much of this onto my ship as possible. Leave this freighter here so I can pretend to my client the contract is still good while we haul ass to anywhere we want."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith will start helping haul stuff over

Narrator:Kaelith silently grabs a cargo cart from a lock against the wall nearby and begins unloading the dragon scales into it. They clatter into the bottom of the cart and he moves on to the spellrifles and pistols.

Notably, the scales do not glow with any magic like the other one he found.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks around for another cart and begins as well if she finds one.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I hate to do this in our first session, but I have to go help my wife with something.

Narrator:She finds one, plenty of them if she needs more. The goods are easy enough to unload, at least the ones meant for people to carry. The munitions are going to be more complicated if you want to get them out. If you don't interrupt each other then an hour will quickly pass, then two hours before you start running into issues moving it into the cargo hold on Asha's ship.

OOC: No problem!

OOC: Thanks for letting us know. We can call it here?

Asha Morrow:OOC totally get it, good luck and thanks for playing tonight :)

Narrator:OOC: Thanks you two :) good start. Nice warmup



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC thanks. it was a good start



Sshado C. (GM):OOC Have a good night!
