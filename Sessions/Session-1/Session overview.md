# Session 1: The Derelict Inuran Stealth Freighter

## Campaign Angle & Core Tensions
- Dual Claims: Kaelith’s salvage contract (keep what he can physically carry) vs Asha’s elite tow contract granting temporary custodianship.
- Misperceptions: Each side may initially assume the other is piratical interference.
- Temporal Pressure: Trade moon negotiations nearing completion; tow rights more valuable if secured before competitors or authorities arrive.
- Historical Weight: Ship dates to final phase of the last major war with Necrotis. Its war cargo was destined for Ternus—ultimately turned against its senders via Nefarious’s corruption.
- Ethical / Contamination Risk: Crated alloy (Blood-Fused Inuran War Alloy) induces nausea or mana vertigo in active mages; possible latent curse residue from Nefarious taint.

## War Alloy (Crated Cargo) – Quick Mechanical Flavor
Name: Blood-Fused Inuran Null Alloy (working label)
Sensory: Slick charcoal plates veined with dull crimson capillary striations; faint iron/salt tang; cold vapor halos.
Effect on Mages (suggested): Within 5 meters of an opened crate, spellcasters suffer -1 (or Disadvantage equivalent) on spell focus / channel checks and must pass a Resolve/Fortitude test to avoid mild nausea. Prolonged exposure (10+ minutes) risks temporary spell limit reduction (-1) until rest.
Salvage Use: Can be refined into anti-magic plating or catalyst dampeners. Keeping intact crates may draw faction interest (confiscation risk).

## Scene Framework (Adjusted)

### Scene 1A – Kaelith’s Contract Brief & Approach
Type: Reaction  
Goal: Kaelith locks the interference source and prioritizes target salvage (armory vs reactor vs stealth lattice).  
Cast: Kaelith; Overseer Talan Vey (holo); faint open-band pings from unknown small craft.  
Setting Hooks: Belt rocks like jagged obsidian fins; sensor UI judders on periodic null pulse; cockpit smells of heated insulation.  
Branching:
- Careful spectral scan: Reveals stealth lattice partial failure + interior micro-power signatures (armory shields flickering).
- Hasty trajectory: Gains speed but increases later stabilization DC.
Agency & Significance: Highlight Kaelith’s expertise—offer unique early knowledge of possible Mark V armor signature.

### Scene 1B – Asha’s Contract Decision
Type: Reaction  
Goal: Asha accepts or negotiates the tow contract terms (custodianship clock starts).  
Cast: Asha; Merchant Sheshiive ir’Inura (silk-intoned encryption); ship VI.  
Setting Hooks: Contract glyph panes rotate like slow coins; subtle jasmine and archival parchment scent from merchant package.  
Branching:
- Immediate acceptance: Secures priority legal claim timestamp—strong leverage later.
- Negotiated clause (hazard surcharge / relic exemption): Improves payout but delays registration (risk Kaelith gains first physical occupation).
- Hesitation: Merchant flags alternate candidate (possible future rival arrival).
Agency: Let Asha insert protective indemnity (reduces later Arbiter penalties if hull destabilizes).

### Scene 2 – Converging Vectors
Type: Reaction (micro Action beats)  
Goal: Bring Kaelith & Asha into sensor/hailing proximity; establish initial relationship stance.  
Cast: Both PCs; Rival Scrapper Pair (Lysa “Pin” Calder & Drusk Var) as a transient ping; malfunctioning beacon drone.  
Setting Hooks: Interference pulses invert HUD color; metallic resonance like a choir bowl after each pulse.  
Branching:
- Cooperative handshake: Shared telemetry reduces hull stabilization difficulty later.
- Silent approach / shadowing: Heightens mutual suspicion; chance of misidentifying each other as pirates when docking.
- Scrapper Intercept: If engaged, rivals can be persuaded into scouting interior hazard.
Agency: Encourage creative transponder spoof or transparency—each drives later trust threshold.

### Scene 3 – Exterior Lock & Hull Breach
Type: Action  
Goal: Establish safe docking/salvage access without triggering latent defense or destabilizing rotation.  
Cast: PCs; possibly Rival Pair lurking; passive presence of Ship Spirit (Whisper-9) observing.  
Setting Hooks: Matte-black hull absorbs starlight; fractal scorch patterns from ancient spell impacts; thin silver vapor filaments vent.  
Challenges (choose 2–3):
1. Rotational Counterthrust (pilot/mechanics check).
2. Stealth Lattice Phase Window (timed breach puzzle).
3. Alloy Contamination Alert (detect & seal crates before exposure).
Branching:
- Precise sequence: Grants safe internal traversal route + Whisper-9 curious rather than hostile.
- Forced breach: Triggers minor internal defense readiness; increases hazard aggression next scene.
Agency: Permit tool improvisation (e.g., resonance tuning fork salvaged from Kaelith’s kit).

### Scene 4 – Claim Clash & Legal Standoff
Type: Reaction (can pivot to Action/Roll-off)  
Goal: Define relationship: joint venture charter, competitive race, or escalating legal conflict.  
Cast: PCs; Overseer Vey or Merchant (remote); Rival Pair; potential Arbiter Caldrin Mox via bureaucratic drone if invoked.  
Setting Hooks: Dock collar hollow echo; holo-doc shards like stained-glass panes; faint subsonic hum from ship core syncing to speech cadence.  
Branching States:
- Joint Charter: Kaelith gets portable relic priority; Asha secures hull structural integrity & tow rights; both adopt shared hazard protocol.
- Legal Escalation: Arbiter review consumes time; interior defense cycles strengthen.
- Aggressive Posturing: Rivals may side with calmer party; hostile party flagged for later legal scrutiny.
Agency: Encourage custom charter clauses (e.g., “Armory gains are split; core spirit custodianship passes to towing party”).

### Scene 5 – Interior Hazard & Armory Discovery
Type: Action  
Goal: Reach armory; overcome guardian OR warding swarm; secure primary loot (armor, pistols, supplies).  
Cast: PCs; Guardian (choose form); Whisper-9 (fragmented); alloy crates; possibly Rival Pair if allied.  
Setting Hooks: Runes flicker like heartbeat; temperature drops abruptly near armory; faint oily incense scent from Nefarious-alloy infusion; distant ticking.  
Guardian Options:
A. Partial Security Golem Torso (grav tendrils): Logic loop—can be placated with command phrase parsing (linguistics / magitech).
B. Glyph Midge Swarm: Environmental casting disruption (imposes spell nausea similar to alloy effect until stabilized).
Armory Layout:
- Rear compartment behind a jammed pressure door; emergency strip-lights flicker amber; racks auto-lock until spirit grants override or door forced (risk damage to armor upgrades).
Branching:
- Diplomatic + Spirit Aid: Safe unlock; full item integrity.
- Forced Entry: One upgrade randomly compromised (GM choice—e.g., Oxygen Tanks dented; lose 30 min duration).
- Stealth Bypass: Leaves guardian active—may pursue or trigger alarm cascade.
Agency: Offer flaw leverage (e.g., Kaelith’s salvage knack reduces damage risk; Asha’s command presence influences AI compliance).
Significance: Each player can customize armor upgrade selection (see Armor Customization layer below).

### Scene 6 – Extraction Decision (Tow vs Strip vs Hybrid)
Type: Reaction (strategic climax)  
Goal: Decide operational end-state for the derelict; set future arc & faction responses.  
Cast: PCs; Whisper-9 (stabilized voice); Tow skiff arrival; remote stakeholders.  
Setting Hooks: Core chamber harmonic resonance shifts to calm; docking countdown holo; alloy crates emit faint red pulses.  
Branching Outcomes:
- Full Tow (Preserve Hull): Merchant favor; latent secrets (hidden manifest sectors). Delayed immediate cash; alloy sickness risk persists until quarantined.
- Strip & Leave: Immediate treasure value; spirit destabilization—future haunting glitch; potential legal audit.
- Hybrid (Detach Stealth Spine + Key Crates): Moderate payout; structural stress event—possible future drifting wreck salvage revisit.
Agency: Provide preview of future hooks for transparency.
Significance: Aligns with long-term character goals (Asha’s reputation vs Kaelith’s rare component portfolio).

## Loot & Item Details (Armory)

### Mark V Inuran Spell Armor (Recovered Set(s))
Base Theme: Late-war refinement blending aerodynamic thruster vanes, layered sigil channels, and obsidian-black plating streaked with faint iridescent circuit veins.

You can allow each PC to configure ONE Mobility + ONE Utility + ONE Hull upgrade. Magical Material can enhance ONE chosen Mobility option.

Mobility Upgrades:
1. Advanced Flight Optimization  
   Flavor: Vented micro-rune cooling petals flare during acceleration; faint sapphire exhaust glyph flickers.  
   Bonus: +30 kph Flight speed.
2. Compressed Oxygen Tanks  
   Flavor: Collapsible micro-canisters click-seal; chest indicator shows green radial bar.  
   Bonus: 2 hours atmospheric containment; immunity to gas attacks.
Magical Material Infusion (Alloyed Blood of Nefarious):  
- Applied to ONE Mobility choice; plating appears slick, wet black with red subdermal shimmer.  
- Bonus: +2 Limit (enables Catalyzation window); can host up to two catalysts (define later).  
- Side Effect (optional): Nearby sensitive casters feel a chill; intimidation boon in social vs enemy cultists.

Utility Upgrades:
1. Potion Loader +3  
   Flavor: Shoulder vertebrae plate opens revealing crystal injection nests; soft chime on auto-administer.  
   Bonus: Load 3 potions; free action (or swift) inject on trigger; track usage per system rules.
2. Shoulder Mounted Linked Gunmount  
   Flavor: Right shoulder folds out a sleek organic-pattern VI-linked cradle; targeting reticle ghosts over user’s aim point.  
   Bonus: Whenever wearer fires a firearm/spellpistol at a target, mount auto-fires adding +2 to base damage of that attack (or separate damage instance—clarify).
Hull Upgrade:
- Kinetic Resistant Padding  
  Flavor: Interior gel lattice warms to user; shock disperses as rippling silver rings under plating.  
  Bonus: +1 Armor (physical kinetic resistance).

Stim Pack (Bundle of 5)
- Description: Clear ampoules with swirling nano-bot particulate; faint antiseptic mint aroma.  
- Use: Inject (action) to restore moderate HP (define exact per rules) or remove minor injury. Usable number of times per rest = Fortitude. Excess attempt causes system fatigue.

Ternus MRE Pack (50 Days)
- Description: Vacuum bricks stamped with faded war-era sigil; rehydration produces gray protein paste; smell of cardboard and old cumin.  
- Use: Sustenance only; morale penalty if relied on exclusively (optional RP incentive).

Inuran Mark III Spellpistols (2)
- Damage: Spell  
- Accuracy: 0  
- Limit: 3  
- Range: 10  
- Ammunition: Spell (draws from wearer or internal micro-focus crystal)  
- Defense Target: Skepticism  
- Cost: 2000 credits  
- Physical Description (Completion): Each pistol seems grown rather than machined—sleek, bio-organic curves of deep obsidian alloy veined with faint violet motes that pulse when charged. Grip ridges adapt subtly to the wielder’s palm temperature. The muzzle houses a spiral focusing helix; when fired it emits a compressed luminous bolt that unspools into a tight corkscrew of light. A low harmonic tone resonates (audible only to the wielder) assisting aim. Inscribed micro-glyph cluster near the receiver can bond to the armor’s VI (if Linked Gunmount present) for synchronized targeting (granting quicker lock acquisition flavor).  
- Optional Quirk: After critical hit, pistol vents a silk-thin shimmer; next reload-free shot gains minor intimidation aura vs targets who witnessed.

---

## Whisper-9 (Ship Spirit / Bound AI Fragment)
Profile: Fragmented cognitive matrix preserving tactical registries, cargo routing heuristics, and wartime counter-intrusion protocols.  
Motivation: Restore chain-of-command authority; prevent unauthorized weapon dispersal; maintain hull integrity for eventual recommission.  
Interaction Modes:
- Curious (if non-destructive breach)
- Defensive (if forced plating fracture or alloy crate mishandled)
- Bargaining (offers manifest data for pledge to tow intact)
Potential Boons:
- Provides encrypted sub-manifest (hidden catalysts, sealed medbay patch kits).
- Grants safe tow sequence reducing structural stress checks.
Potential Consequences (if antagonized):
- Random corridor seal events (time loss)
- Alloy crate auto-opening (increased mage sickness zone)

---

## Rival Scrappers (Lysa “Pin” & Drusk Var)
Use: Flexible relationship barometer; early minor complication or later scout asset.  
Hooks:
- If treated fairly: Offer quick map of collapsed corridors (saves 1 hazard roll).
- If threatened: Plant a timed cutter charge near stealth lattice (structural integrity penalty).

---

## Agency & Significance Prompts
Offer each PC a personal spotlight:
- Kaelith: Unique salvage decision—extract stealth emitter shard (future stealth bonus) vs leave for charter goodwill.
- Asha: Decide to preserve Whisper-9 (earning merchant’s advanced tow certification endorsement) vs accelerate strip for immediate capital.
- Joint: Draft Salvage/Tow Charter (write one-paragraph contract; mechanical effect: +1 cooperative action reroll per session while both parties remain signatories).

---

## Consequence Matrix Snapshot
| Choice | Immediate | Mid-Term Hook | Risk |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------|
| Full Tow | Merchant favor, intact AI | Trade moon docking VIP lane | Lower instant cash |
| Strip Core & Armory | High quick wealth | Legal audit / Arbiter scene | Spirit hostility |
| Hybrid Extraction | Balanced returns | Future drifting hull salvage | Structural instability event |
| Preserve Spirit | Tow boon, secret manifest | AI evolving personality | Potential moral dilemmas |
| Destroy Spirit | Extra salvage components | Reputation penalty (Inuran circles) | Haunting sensor glitches |

---

## Optional Joint Charter (Template Snippet)
Phrase something like:
“By mutual accord, Captain Asha (Custodian) and Salvager Kaelith (Field Extractor) hereby establish cooperative claim over Inuran Freighter Designate [Temp ID]. Portable relics, personal arms, and catalysts: priority Kaelith. Hull, drive arrays, lattice structural segments: priority Asha. Armory high-tier assets (armor sets, pistols) equitably divided. Ship Spirit Whisper-9 custodianship under Asha’s tow authority. Disputes deferred to Deputy Arbiter Mox. Charter valid until hull enters Trade Moon dock or voluntary dissolution.”

Mechanical Benefit (suggested): Each gains one “Charter Leverage” token—spend to downgrade a social conflict consequence or reroll a joint teamwork check.

---

## Follow-Up Hooks for Session 2
- Trade Moon Arrival: Inspection gauntlet; hidden faction interest in null alloy.
- Arbiter Audit: Legality scene—needs charter clarity & spirit testimony.
- Nefarious Alloy Catalysts: Potential corruption purification side-quest.
- Whisper-9 Evolution: Requests relocation to a secure core cradle, offering navigation buff.

---

## GM Prep Checklist
- Finalize DC equivalents for: Hull Stabilization, Lattice Timing, Guardian Negotiation, Alloy Exposure Resistance.
- Decide Guardian form (Golem vs Swarm) matching party strengths (avoid hard counter out of gate).
- Pick 2 hidden manifest items (e.g., Catalyst Seed, Experimental Rune Battery) to reveal only if spirit preserved.
- Assign potential armor Magical Material infusion to one PC (possibly treat as a negotiated shared choice).

If you’d like I can next:
1. Produce exact mechanical DC ranges & encounter stat scaffolding.
2. Draft the contract as a Markdown file ready for the repo.
3. Generate a loot tracking sheet or salvage log.

Let me know which you prefer (or all). Any tweaks before locking this into a file?
