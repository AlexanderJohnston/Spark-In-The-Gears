Session 1

Kaelith is on a contract to salvage what is suspected to be a stealth freighter resting derelict in the system's asteroid belt. Sensors have gone out in the area more than once, so a crew worked to track down the location of the interference and found a wreck there. Kaelith can keep anything he can carry out. They're after the big ticket items. Weapons, relics, ammo and tech.

Asha is at home when a new contract comes through. A trade moon is expected to appear in system for a period of five years whenever negotiations are complete. An Inuran merchant who will be arriving with it has put in a request for a competent captain to tow an old freighter into dock from the asteroid belt. The rate is exceptionally good, as much as ten usual jobs. Enough for a serious upgrade to her ship or a comfortable amount of savings. She is given temporary legal rights to the ship if the contract is accepted, creating a clash between her and any crew she brings, Kaelith, and the crew who hired him. Both will likely think the other to be pirates.

The ship is an old Inuran vessel from the last major war with Necrotis. It is carrying crates stuffed full of a peculiar metal alloy which will cause mages to feel ill around it, as well as high grade ammunition for battleship class ships with large cannons. The vessel was delivering weapons to Ternus, weapons which would be turned on them by the dark god Nefarious before she was defeated. There is an armory at the back of the freighter where Asha and Kaelith can both find a set of Mark V Inuran spell armor made with magically enhanced materials. They also find two Inuran Mark III spellpistols, fifty MREs, and some stim packs.

### Spell Armor Mk. V found in the armory

Mobility Upgrades
Advanced Flight Optimization: Adding advanced cooling valves to the armor’s thrusters using advanced magically enhanced alloys, the armor is able to gain a significant increase to speed.
Bonus: Adds 30 kph Flight

Compressed Oxygen Tanks: A thorough magically enhanced atmospheric sealing and integrated micro canisters of oxygen allows the armor wearer to operate in hostile environments.
Bonus: Armor is Atmospherically contained for 2 hours, immunity to gas attack

Magical Material +2 on Advanced Flight Optimizations
Any, but only one, of the Mobility options can be made with a magical material, increasing the armors limit by one. The exact flourishes added, if any, depends on the material used, and the whims of the gamemaster. Remember to define which option Magical material is added too.
Bonus: +2 Limit (Makes Catalyzation possible)
Material: Alloyed blood of Nefarious. The alloy is a slick, dark metal, almost wet looking. It creates an intimidating effect and can be infused with up to two catalysts.

Utility Upgrades
Potion Loader +3
An upper back mounted compartment that allows a potion to be loaded into the armor and be injected into the wearer as needed.
Bonus: 3 potions can be loaded into the armor and injected as needed at a later time.

Shoulder Mounted Linked Gunmount
A VI controlled right-shoulder mounted spellpistol, will assist the armor wearer in combat. When not activated the mount will retract and fold to the back of the armor. 
Bonus: The spell pistol will automatically fire at anything the wearer fires at, adding +2 to the base damage of the wearer’s firearm attacks.

Hull Upgrades
Kinetic Resistant Padding
This inner layer of padding offers a comfortable and protective cushion between the armor and wearer.
Bonus: +1 Armor


### Additional Items Found In Armory

One pack of five Stims
Description: An injectable medicine containing painkillers and healing nano-bots to promote regener- ation. Stim, Medpatch, Medkit can only be used number of times equal to Fortitude before resting.

Fifty pack of Ternus MREs
Description: These freeze dried rations were created during the war. It's unclear when the war was fought, but having eaten one of these I'd wager centuries ago. It's bad. Real bad. Each pack will sustain you for a day, though you won't enjoy it.
