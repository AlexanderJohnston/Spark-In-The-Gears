# Session 1 Opener & Initial Scenes

## Campaign Opener (Read-Aloud)
The system's outer asteroid belt drifts in slow, silent arcs. Among them hangs the almost imperceptible silhouette of an old Inuran stealth freighter, a war-era hull which once carried munitions and alloy crates meant for Ternus during some unknown war campaign of the past. This vessel was one of perhaps many lost to history, and this load of cargo never reached its intended front. Little of this would be known to anyone discovering it however.

Today the freighter is inert. No active defenses. No resident crew. It is derelict with faded plating, sealed compartments, and potentially valuable materials.

## Scene for Asha – Apartment Contract Decision

### Read-Aloud (Primary)
Your megablock apartment is a compact refuge. Filtered air rushes through the intake above a basic door. A neat, well-used bed sits opposite a muted holoscreen cycling trade news in translucent slate. A kettle's residual warmth clings to the small stove. A new encrypted contract pane blossoms on the holoscreen, six crescent glyph seals rotating slowly as a figureless voice speaks:

"Captain Asha. An Inuran war-era freighter drifts in your belt. I require intact tow custody before commercial phase begins. Ten standard hauls' payment. Timestamp acceptance grants temporary legal rights for you over the hull, permitting it to clear any docking permits. Will you accept?"

### Optional Sensory Details
- Battery status bar: Five green segments (small battery reserve).
- Holoscreen glow: Pale slate light. Scrolling news about the war.
- Air filter: Gentle cyclical hiss; crisp, ionized freshness.
- Sensor strip on the door frame: Blue idle pulse every few seconds.
- Ambient: Distant elevator hum, muffled structural groan like slow breathing.

### Player Agency Prompts
- Accept immediately (fast timestamp, highest legal leverage) or negotiate a hazard clause (slight delay, potential improved payout)?
- Publicly broadcast custodianship ID now (reduces pirate suspicion later) or remain quiet to avoid alerting other salvagers?
- Quick registry cross-check: Do you spend a few minutes verifying if a salvage ping is already on record?
- Begin prepping tow equipment list (commit to intact hull) or draft fallback plan for partial strip (hybrid approach)?

### Consequence Seeds
- Immediate acceptance: Strong footing in later claim discussion.
- Negotiation delay: Risk Kaelith's crew physically enters first; you argue legality from outside.
- Public broadcast: Smoother diplomacy; also signals opportunity to prowling independents.
- Silence: More suspicion later—might need extra proof you're not hijacking.

### Transition Line
As your decision logs, a vector packet updates your ship's departure queue; interference cycle countdown flickers—your window to arrive before deep salvage begins is narrowing.

## Scene for Kaelith – Approach & Entry Choice

### Read-Aloud (Primary)

Kaelith took this contract on short notice after a recommendation from a student he once mentored in the Resonant Veil, someone who couldn't take the job themselves and passed along "a reliable micro-crew hungry for a score." These two are competent but untested with him personally.

They arrive, floating a few dozen kilometers away from the derelict's hull. It is a matte-black slab swallowing reflected starlight, framed by slow-spinning asteroid fragments. An intact airlock ring sits half-shadowed; its panel is lifeless. Tessa holds your vessel in a steady hover, thrusters feathering micro-corrections. Joren rolls a slim plasma cutter between his fingers; a controlled ember pulses at its tip. The nearby radio channel remains silent. 

Tessa “Spoke” Arden is a lean, grease-fingered pilot with a habit of counting maneuver timings under her breath; she favors clean entries, catalogued hull condition, and keeping resale value intact. Her brother Joren is broader, burn-scarred, and impatient. He sits, twirling a plasma cutter like a baton and pushing for fast action over finesse.

Tessa Arden is lean and angular, built like the ship's control yoke she rarely lets go of. Close cropped dark hair shows a faint graphite sheen under the cockpit lights. A narrow, triangular scar sits at her temple where a headset once tore skin. Her flight harness is a worn copper-tan rig layered with sewn patch straps, scuffed at hip and shoulder from countless side-load dockings. Grease-black smudges stain the pads of her fingers and she wipes them absently on a gray cloth tucked beneath her collar before touching an antique panel. Her stance says held tension and controlled restraint.

Joren Arden stands half-turned toward the scry screen, broader through the chest and shoulders, posture casual like he's leaning into a bar conversation with danger. Burn-scar tracer lines, thin amber veins, web his forearms, disappearing under heat-scarred gloves. His hair is a tousled dark nest, a few strands singed lighter near the ends. His boots are heavier salvage pattern with the carbon toes scuffed white from age. Where Tessa is tight focus, Joren is kinetic readiness.



## Tessa “Spoke” Arden
Role: Pilot / basic crew lead  
Core Traits: Precise, cautious, professional veneer  
Looks: Lean, close-cropped dark hair, scuffed copper flight harness  
Competence: Solid docking and approach; average shot; basic structural scan  
Habits: Counts down maneuvers softly; wipes gloves before touching antique panels  
Motivation (Immediate): Get paid; prove “we do clean entries”  
Default Attitude: Businesslike; trusts numbers, not promises  
Weakness: Freezes briefly when rushed into messy breaching 

## Joren Arden
Role: Enforcer / fire mage  
Core Traits: Impatient, bold, likes visible progress  
Looks: Broad, forearm flame-scar lines, heat-scarred gauntlet  
Competence: Fast thermal cutting; intimidation; rough improvised cover  
Habits: Flips cutting torch idly; names each cut (“Ribbon One”)  
Motivation (Immediate): Be first inside; grab one flashy item  
Default Attitude: Friendly swagger; pokes at delays  
Weakness: Claustrophobic twinge entering tight sealed compartments (plays it off)  

### Crew Input (Use or Paraphrase)
- Tessa: “If we power the ring and spoof a maintenance handshake, we retain hull value. That helps if we end up sharing with a tow captain.”
- Joren: “Ten minutes of heat along the seam and we're inside before anyone else. Hull pretty is hull slow.”
- Kaelith (Player): Decides path—speed vs diplomacy leverage.

### Binary Choice

1. Cut Through (Thermal / Mechanical Breach)
   - Pros: Fastest; immediate access to interior (armory priority). Joren morale boost.
   - Cons: Scorched plating reduces intact hull valuation; Asha (later) gains negotiation leverage citing damage; minor visual sign of aggressive salvage.

   Suggested Flavor Outcome:
   “The plating softens and curls; a dark gap exhales stale, dust-edged air. You mark the scorched ring for later catalog.”

2. Hack & Cycle Airlock
   - Pros: Preserves hull value; professional entry stance; Tessa morale boost; clean seal re-usable for tow.
   - Cons: Slower; risk another claimant arriving during cycle; Joren impatience seed.

   Suggested Flavor Outcome:
   “Aux power hums along the patch cable. The panel flickers green; a dry pressure hiss, then the hatch unlocks with a reluctant clunk.”

Optional Hybrid:
- Begin hack; if panel remains dead, shift to a controlled, minimal-scorch cut. Neutral leverage outcome.

### Player Agency Prompts
- Declare entry method.
- Broadcast salvage ID now (reduces piracy suspicion) or maintain radio silence (speeds interior move but increases later distrust).
- Allocate tasks: Tessa handling panel power, Joren on standby, or Joren initiating controlled thermal lance.
- Quick inventory: Tag crates immediately upon entry or head straight for armory location?

### Consequences (Narrative Tags)
- “Scorched Hatch” (Cut): Asha can cite reduced tow value; Kaelith proves swift initiative.
- “Professional Entry” (Hack): Gains positive point in negotiation; slower path risks simultaneous arrival.
- “Controlled Breach” (Hybrid): Balanced; minimal leverage shift either way.

### Transition Line
Decision made, your crew moves—either through a clean cycling door or the glowing oval of a fresh cut—into dark passageways that still might hold the preserved armory and alloy crates. Elsewhere in the system, a tow captain finishes stamping a lucrative custodianship contract.

## Armory Expectations (For Later Scenes)
- Mark V Spell Armor (customizable upgrades; one set per participant if negotiated).
- 2 Inuran Mark III Spellpistols.
- 5 Stims (pack).
- 50 Ternus MREs.
- Crates of Blood-Fused Null Alloy + battleship-grade ammunition (heavy; towing vs stripping debate).

No automated defenses; any division rests solely on arrival order, negotiation, and chosen methodology.

### Optional Opening Table Prompt
“Why is your character invested in the freighter's fate—profit, reputation, a war history tie, curiosity about alloy properties, or ship upgrade goals? Declare one now; I'll thread it into future negotiation leverage.”
