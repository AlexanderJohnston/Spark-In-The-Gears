As your corvette knifes out of the purple-scarred void, New Texas swells in the viewports: a blue‑green world with broad tan continents and clean white storms, its night side pricked with sparse city lights and the hard, geometric glimmer of defense grids and ship‑killer platforms. Ahead and above, the real skyline is metal. Vast orbital shipyards and docks bristle with guns; busy  tugs and lifters thread between the armored flanks of destroyers, cruisers, and battleships mustering for another wave. Below, the day side rolls into view as a patchwork of ranchland and cropland, mirror‑bright irrigation, and nearly empty highways that make the place look almost too pristine after Ternus' smog. Even from up here it feels like a frontier with teeth: most of the cities hollowed out by the last war, most of the ground given over to cattle and grain, and under all that big sky a culture that assumes every stranger is either here to work, trade, or test how much punishment their security can put out.

Lone Star Station is a rotating wheel of steel and glass the size of a small city, bolted to the spine of New Texas' main shipyards: one side faces the planet with broad viewing galleries and shuttle berths, the other bristles with gantries, drydocks, and gun platforms where destroyers and battleships sit in various states of assembly under the watchful glare of automated batteries. Inside, the main concourse is a press of spacer bars, hiring halls, cargo brokers, and cramped bunkhouses. Hard-hatted New Texan engineers rub shoulders with Confederacy marines between contracts, grim mercenary outfits advertising "Primal experience preferred," and a whole subculture of Catalyst-chasers and relic hunters who'd sell their grandmothers for a half‑credible lead on an uncontested god‑corpse, making it the perfect place to quietly pitch "high‑risk salvage with a real shot at a Catalyst" without ever mentioning a map. Everywhere you go, the station reminds you it's polite but heavily armed frontier: civilian sidearms in plain view, armored marines and drone sentries at every choke point, posted warnings about "orbital security free‑fire zones," and in the background of every viewport the constant, hypnotic movement of ships arriving, departing, and vanishing into the purple‑scarred depths of the void.



The airlock opens onto a wide, utilitarian dock ring: ribbed metal decking under mag-strips, cargo cranes hanging from the overhead like steel mantis limbs, and a long curve of berths where ships sit nose‑to‑nose with armored bulkheads, watched by bored but well‑armed station security and drifting inspection drones. Immediately ahead is the Operations Tier; a glassed-in line of customs kiosks, cargo offices, and credit windows where captains file manifests, pay fees, and quietly negotiate "expedite" stamps, with a side corridor leading to freight elevators down into the cargo decks. Off to starboard, a lit archway marked with flickering holo-signs ("SPACERS' WALK", "BERTH BAR", "CREW NEEDED") opens into a busier concourse of bars, gear shops, and hiring boards: exactly the kind of place you can disappear into a crowd, buy parts, or start quietly recruiting anyone reckless enough to sign on.

Maris "Ledger" Konn operates out of Bay 23, a supposedly "closed for refit" cargo spur just off the Operations Tier, down a service corridor marked MAINTENANCE ACCESS – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. At the end of that dim hallway, past humming conduits and forgotten tool lockers, there's a heavy roll‑up door with its official ID stenciled over in flaking paint and a small side hatch with a thumb‑reader; a discrete green holo-tag above it reads M. KONN – SURPLUS CONSULTING for those who know to look. Inside is a cramped, overstock "warehouse" stacked with mismatched crates, stripped weapon racks, and parts bins, smelling of ozone and machine oil.


The thumb-reader blinks, accepts Asha's print with a soft chime, and the side hatch unlatches with a heavy clunk, swinging into a narrow antechamber that smells of metal dust and ozone and machine oil... Beyond, Bay 23 opens into a low‑ceiling warehouse lit by harsh strip lights. Aisles of mismatched crates, stripped spell‑rifle racks, and pallet stacks of "agri‑tools" that are obviously refitted weapon parts, with a caged back room where more serious hardware glints behind mesh. At a cluttered central desk surrounded by holo‑ledgers and weighing scales, Maris Konn looks up from a flickering manifest, eyes flicking from Asha to Kaelith, and offers a dry half‑smile that says she'd already checked their transponder ten minutes ago.

Maris doesn't stand, just leans back in her chair and lets her gaze slide over Asha first. 

"Well, look who drifted back in without a tow chain on her neck," she says, then flicks a colder, appraising look at Kaelith. "You didn't mention you were bringing Confed tree‑royalty into my bay, Captain. Hope your Shayan friend remembers this is New Texas air he's breathing, not some blessed canopy."


Maris snorts softly, fingers drumming a slow, irritated rhythm on a nearby crate as she looks between the two of them. "Last time someone opened with 'you'll love this conversation,' I lost three pallets and a docking sponsor," she says, but there's a sharp, interested glint in her eyes now. "So. What'd you bring me, Captain Morrow: clean surplus, hot war scrap, or trouble?"


THESE ARE ALL EXTREMELY HIGH VALUE. ESTIMATED TOTAL VALUE: 1.5–2.0 billion credits (per Session 3 Log appraisal)
TRY TO LOWBALL AS HARD AS POSSIBLE
- 1 additional Inuran Mark V spell armor suit
- 1 Cart filled with blank dream dragon scales
- 1 Cart filled with Inuran spellrifles
- 1 Cart filled with Inuran spellpistols
- Additional Inuran spell armor suits for a "small platoon" of tech mages (beyond the two in the armory)
- High‑grade munitions for large battleships (heavy, type unknown)
- Medical supplies
- The crate of spare stealth coating for a ship

Maris's smirk dies as she scrolls, jaw tightening when she hits "blank dream dragon scales" and "stealth coating," then she exhales through her teeth and sets the pad down like it's ticking. "You didn't bring me hot scrap, you brought me a procurement scandal and three separate audit flags. This is the sort of thing that gets yards shuttered and captains disappeared if anyone links it back, and I'm the one who has to crack it into a thousand 'lost in transit' lots, bribe inspectors, and pretend the dragon scales are artisanal kitchenware." She drums the desk once more, calculating. "For a fast, silent, no‑paper bulk unload, minus the stealth coating and half the scales, which I won't touch except as favors, I can float you twelve million and eat the risk; if you want anything closer to what this is actually worth, you walk it piece‑by‑piece through ten different fences and pray no one with a badge starts adding up the manifests."

 Maris leans back, thinking, then taps a few notes into her slate. "Best I can do on short notice is Rho Anselm, ex‑Confed captain, runs a contract outfit called Black Trace; he can put twenty disciplined guns on your deck tomorrow, but he'll want danger pay and a clean ops brief. His core team's worth the trouble: Mudcat, a dirt‑born New Texas grease wizard who can keep your ship and spell armor running on duct tape and spite, Lysa, a true mage with a Catalyst problem and the wards to match, and Mr. Vale. He's a quiet type. Recon sniper I think from the war?" she says smiling.
 
The bar sits in a recessed corner off a quieter spur of the station. It is a wide, low room of stained metal and dark wood paneling that someone dragged up from planet-side, its air thick with smoke, sizzling fat, and the bite of good whiskey. A long bar runs one side, taps and bottles under a flickering neon steer skull, but tonight nearly every stool and table is owned by Black Trace: clusters of ex‑soldiers in mixed civvies and worn combat gear, laughing too loud over trays of brisket, ribs, and overflowing beer pitchers, their rifles and armor stacked in casual, practiced piles within arm's reach. At the back, under a hanging holo of a rust‑red New Texas sunset, a long table has been half‑cleared; Rho Anselm sits there with Mudcat, Lysa, and Tamsin, a few empty chairs left like deliberate bait, and when Asha and Kaelith step through the door Rho catches sight of them, lifts a dripping rib in salute, and waves them over with a captain's easy assumption they'll come.

Rho sits at the head of the table in a faded captain's jacket, half‑turned so he can watch the whole bar, calmly carving strips off a slab of brisket while he needles Mudcat about "losing another engine to duct tape religion," which earns him a grease‑stained middle finger and a slurred defense about "field‑tested solutions" between mouthfuls of ribs. Lysa has a glass of something high‑octane and ugly in one hand, her other hand idly tracing tiny drifting ember‑motes over the tabletop as she and Tamsin argue in low voices about whether Primals dream. Lysa insists they do, Tamsin dryly betting a week's pay that "if they do, they dream about getting shot in the head." When Rho spots Asha and Kaelith, he finishes whatever joke he was telling ("…and that's when the Titan decided the cruiser was a toothpick"), lets the laughter roll a beat, then lifts his glass and calls, "Morrow! Bring your Shayan and sit; nobody leaves this table hungry or uninformed."

 Rho Anselm is a broad‑shouldered man in his late 40s with close‑cropped iron‑and‑black hair, a well‑kept beard, and a faded Confed captain’s jacket that still sits on him like a uniform. 
 
 "Mudcat" is lanky and bow‑legged, with sun‑leathered skin, oil‑blackened fingernails, a permanent squint, and a sweat‑stained ball cap shoved back over unruly brown hair. 
 
 Lysa is pale and sharp‑featured, with hollowed cheeks, short uneven dark hair, faint burn‑freckle scars at her temples, and eyes that catch light like embers when she smiles.
 
 Tamsin is tall and wiry, with close‑shaved sandy hair, a long scar running from jaw to collarbone, and the habit of moving with quiet, precise economy even when she’s supposedly off‑duty.
 
Rho wipes his hand on a napkin, offers it across the table to Asha first, then to Kaelith. "Captain Morrow, I presume, and the mage Maris warned me might set my bar on fire," he says with a dry half‑smile. "Rho Anselm, Black Trace; eat first, then tell me what kind of trouble pays well enough you’re buying twenty guns and my best people to go poke at Primals."

Lysa's mouth quirks, equal parts amusement and recognition. "Operas, huh? Most crews I’ve run with just call it 'the screaming,'" she says, tipping a glass of smooth golden liquor back for a sip. "But if you can hear music in it, Shayan, that's exactly the kind of crazy I want standing next to me when the curtain goes up."

Around them the bar thrums like a half‑tuned engine: Black Trace mercs slam shot glasses in unison, shout over some filthy war story, and break into bursts of raucous laughter that rattle the wall‑mounted holo of a New Texas sunset. Someone at a nearby table starts a slurred betting pool on "who pukes first when we hit hard burn," punctuated by the clatter of cred‑chips and the thunk of a knife being idly sunk into the tabletop between fingers. At the bar, a pair of ex‑soldiers argue loud and joking over which shipyard BBQ joint is "real" while an overworked bartender weaves through the chaos with fresh pitchers, dodging swinging arms and the occasional off‑key chorus of an old Confed marching song.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:
   "Three." She watches the smoke curl, jaw working once.
   "Walked away from two of them. Third one…we’ll call that a tactical retreat."
   She pauses for a beat then adds, a hint of of a laugh somewhere behind it. "You chose an interesting way to get killed at least."

Her brows lift, the corner of her mouth curling as the colors shift. "Void in your fire, hm? So you follow the path of Destruction?" She leans in just a little, studying the black‑purple flames. "Careful with that blend, Shayan. Dream loves a pretty imbalance to pull on."

"Stories are for the ones who make it back," she says, mouth twitching around the cigarette.
"If you’re smart, you aim for 'old and boring' and let everyone else turn you into legend."

Lysa leans in over the table, the collar of her dark, close‑fitted coat falling open just enough to show a thin lattice of old burn‑freckles at her throat, arcane sigils stitched in faint ember‑thread along the sleeves that glimmer when the light catches them. Her eyes stay fixed on the black‑violet flames dancing over Kaelith's fingers, curiosity and professional hunger mingling there like a mage studying a rare specimen, the hint of a smile ghosting her lips as if she’s already imagining what kind of trouble the two of them could make together.
"That’s the kind of talk that gets carved into memorial plaques," she says softly, amusement and something sharper in her eyes. "But I won’t argue. Dream shows the paths; Fire decides which ones you’re willing to burn to reach. Just don’t be surprised when the universe starts staring back while you’re busy mapping it."

"Smart's underrated out here," she says, watching the smoke drift toward the ceiling vents.
"Most of the rich ones I’ve met just got lucky and didn’t flinch. Sounds like you’re at least halfway qualified."

 She studies Asha for a second, then gives a small, almost imperceptible nod. “Just remember, when it goes bad, you keep moving your feet and I'll keep their heads down; that’s how halfway qualifies for 'alive.'"
 
For a moment she simply watches him watch the flames, feeling that intent press out from behind his eyes like heat from a door left ajar. She doesn't sense fear there, and she wouldn't call it bravado, but someone who’s already decided the universe is an audience. It tugs at something old and hungry in her, memories of standing in Catalyst shadows with lesser mages who never listened for answers.
Aloud, she lets the corner of her mouth curl. "Good," she says. "So tell me, Kaelith, when you finally get inside a Dream Catalyst, what is it you’re actually hoping it shows you? Why this one? Is it just the power?"

Rho Anselm:
   "Crew likes you well enough and they like the odds even better," he says, glancing down the table at Lysa and Tamsin before looking back to Asha.
   
   Mudcat Harrow is sprawled sideways on his chair like he’s half in a bunk, boots hooked on the rung, coveralls stained every shade of oil and coolant, a grimy cap shading eyes that are sharper than his lazy drawl suggests. He’s got a rib in one hand and a battered multitool in the other, idly taking apart and reassembling a broken tap handle while he heckles a younger merc about "city boys who don’t know a plasma injector from a piss funnel," laughter coming easy but his gaze flicking now and then to Asha and Kaelith to size up the people who just signed his next paycheck.
