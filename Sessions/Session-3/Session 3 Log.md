Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Welcome!

OOC: How's everyone tonight



Wartok:OOC - hey all

Asha Morrow:OOC howdy



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - lol come up with an age yet, Wartok?

OOC - I forgot about that



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I was thinking about 150



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Sounds about right. Still quite young for a Shayan in the grand scheme, and considering his roots./



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - agreed



Narrator:As your corvette knifes out of the purple-scarred void, New Texas swells in the viewports: a blue‑green world with broad tan continents and clean white storms, its night side pricked with sparse city lights and the hard, geometric glimmer of defense grids and ship‑killer platforms. Ahead and above, the real skyline is metal. Vast orbital shipyards and docks bristle with guns; busy tugs and lifters thread between the armored flanks of destroyers, cruisers, and battleships mustering for another wave. Below, the day side rolls into view as a patchwork of ranchland and cropland, mirror‑bright irrigation, and nearly empty highways that make the place look almost too pristine after Ternus' smog. Even from up here it feels like a frontier with teeth: most of the cities hollowed out by the last war, most of the ground given over to cattle and grain, and under all that big sky a culture that assumes every stranger is either here to work, trade, or test how much punishment their security can put out.

OOC: More coming, feel free to chat if you want just writing it out.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"The surface always looks so pristine from up here. It's been a while since I have been here though."



Narrator:Lone Star Station is a rotating wheel of steel and glass the size of a small city, bolted to the spine of New Texas' main shipyards: one side faces the planet with broad viewing galleries and shuttle berths, the other bristles with gantries, drydocks, and gun platforms where destroyers and battleships sit in various states of assembly under the watchful glare of automated batteries. Inside, the main concourse is a press of spacer bars, hiring halls, cargo brokers, and cramped bunkhouses. Hard-hatted New Texan engineers rub shoulders with Confederacy marines between contracts, grim mercenary outfits advertising "Primal experience preferred," and a whole subculture of Catalyst-chasers and relic hunters who'd sell their grandmothers for a half‑credible lead on an uncontested god‑corpse, making it the perfect place to quietly pitch "high‑risk salvage with a real shot at a Catalyst" without ever mentioning a map.

Ship is currently leaving the Umbral shadow and can head to Lone Star, or look for even more discrete places to recruit.

Asha Morrow:"Same, even just to dock let alone the surface. Should be some nice barbecue even up here though." Asha grins and starts to pull into Lone Star Station. "We should get settled here at Lone Star and make some decisions about our cargo. I think I'll keep the other spell armor we have that matches yours and I think we should keep the stealth coating as it would be hard to source again. Everything else could go though in my opinion, maybe you'd prefer to keep some medical supplies. Thoughts?" she speaks matter of factly without looking away from setting their course.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I would tend to agree with that assessment, unless you find yourself in need of one of the rifles or pistols. And perhaps keeping a few scales could be useful. As for the BBQ, I think you find it more appealing than I, but it is not too bad."

Asha Morrow:"Fair enough, I agree we should keep a sample of the various supplies I'll do that before we leave. Our priority should be selling all that we can, hopefully all of what we're going to sell, and then we need to start approaching people for a catalyst run." She looks at Kaelith now, "That map is priceless and anyone, even the best of people, would kill us for it. Let's not mention it. This will be a...'reliable lead' on a single catalyst that we need primal-experienced mercs for."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Added Cheat Sheet - A List of Useful Pages, anyone can edit this if you find a page to add.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith smirks and chuckles_ "People would kill us for it. And I will kill them to keep it. Agreed however on the proceedings, as well as the single Catalyst Op."

Asha Morrow:Asha relaxes a bit, "Cool. I think the opportunity to reach a catalyst is enough for most people to want to come even without payment." she double checks their course to dock, "Alright I'm gonna go grab the armor, a spell rifle and pistol and a health potion to store in my room while we approach Lone Star, be right back." she hurries off



Narrator:OOC: Is your armor on Kaelith



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - he is going to look for quarters to store it in



Narrator:OOC - Wearing it right now though?



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC yes

_Kaelith heads to cargo and grabs a few dragon scales before looking for quarters to store them and his armor in_



Narrator:OOC: Sharing stats for future reference

Kaelith's HUD display suddenly shifts in hue from yellow to a soft green. The unknown meter labeled "magic" ticks up to 2%. The potion loader indicators flicker once, notifying you that they are empty. An interface appears, attempting to connect to something that isn't there for several seconds before terminating itself.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - thanks

"Damn I wish this thing had a user manual."



Narrator:OOC: Asha do you want to describe your quarters? I have one prepped I can throw in.

Asha Morrow:Asha stashes the spell armor, a couple of dream scales, a spell rifle, a spell pistol, and two health potions in her room before returning to the command deck to be there for docking.

OOC feel free, it'd be pretty typical if a bit cluttered with random stuff



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Once Kaelith has store his items in the quarters, he heads to the airlock to await Asha_



Narrator:Asha's crew quarters are compact but carefully claimed. The space has a narrow bunk built into the wall with a neatly folded, well‑used blanket, opposite a muted holoscreen that usually cycles her favorite feeds and war news when she's off duty. One corner is all functional lockers and hard cases stacked with flight gear, living supplies, and now the freshly secured Inuran spell rifle, pistol, and health potion laid out on a magnet strip above a fold‑down desk littered with contract tokens and old cargo manifests.

When she returns, the bridge is quiet for several moments before the ship indicates Kaelith is waiting at the airlock. The ship has moved into general docking range of the station but is just hanging right now safely out of the way of any traffic.

Comms channels indicate that her transponder has been picked up and docking control is ready to handle her when she's ready.

Asha Morrow:Asha hands over docking control.



Narrator:An automated request for your cargo manifest comes through, preventing the docking control from initiating. Your ship has been flagged as originating out of system.

Asha Morrow:OOC what would lying look like here?

OOC how would that work



Narrator:OOC You could send a false manifest, but that won't go over well if they decide to look.

OOC Lying here would be dealing with the consequences of being honest or lying about the manifest itself, what happens after

OOC Or rather, that's when your chances to lie would show up

Asha Morrow:OOC would a captain think it likely for them to check cargo? how bad an idea is it to forge a manifest?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - It's a pretty bad idea. You could be blacklisted from the system especially with the type of cargo you have. Or worse, jailed.

OOC - But it's not like they check every ship. Unless you give them a reason to, maybe only ten percent get looked at.

OOC - What you define as "giving them a reason to" though depends on you. Walking out in spell armor wouldn't be a good start for example.

Asha Morrow:OOC I'm just thinking about not wanting a paper trail of us having the stuff from the freighter, whoever contracted that job knew what they were looking for



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Indeed, big choice.



Narrator:The airlock is a quiet space for now, Kaelith. Asha is either taking a while or got tied up at the bridge.

Asha Morrow:OOC I guess Asha will lie, come up with mundane cargo. maybe supplies, raw materials for the docks, stuff like that



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Tired of waiting, Kaelith heads back to the bridge to check there_

Asha Morrow:Asha explains the situation to Kaelith as she is drafting a forged manifest.



Sshado C. (GM):Asha, try a Larceny roll at DT 1

Asha Morrow:

|Asha Morrow|
|---|
|Larceny|
|1 Successes|
|(4+0) Agility  <br>(0+0) Larceny (TN5)  <br>(0) Bonus Dice  <br>(0) Edge|



Narrator:The forgery is good. Asha carefully ensures the weights all match up. It looks clean, and matches what her type of ship would normally carry. Just enough to be worth visiting, but not enough to be interesting. And not any material that would be in too high of demand.

Asha Morrow:Asha looks over at Kaelith and gives a relieved thumbs up, "I think we're alright, hold your breath we don't get checked."



Narrator:The prompt on her terminal waits blinking slowly, waiting for her to send.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Fingers crossed. Hopefully we don't have to fight our way out of here." _Kaelith chuckles_

Asha Morrow:Asha hits it



Narrator:The manifest is accepted and a few moments later the system pings back your docking identifier, vectors to guide you in automatically, and a clear status array, meaning you were not flagged for random cargo check.

Your account is automatically deducted 500 credits for the docking fee.

Asha Morrow:Asha sighs and turns back to Kaelith again, this time with a double thumbs up "We're gold."

Asha sets course to follow the docking vectors to their spot



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Now we just need to find some quiet buyers and offload this stuff."

Asha Morrow:"If we're allowed a little more luck at this point maybe I'll have a good contact that's here right now."



Narrator:The ship settles in comfortably to its berth at the docks. The viewscreens show a busy but well-ordered system going on down below.

The airlock opens onto a wide, utilitarian dock ring: ribbed metal decking under mag-strips, cargo cranes hanging from the overhead like steel mantis limbs, and a long curve of berths where ships sit nose‑to‑nose with armored bulkheads, watched by bored but well‑armed station security and drifting inspection drones. Immediately ahead is the Operations Tier; a glassed-in line of customs kiosks, cargo offices, and credit windows where captains file manifests, pay fees, and quietly negotiate "expedite" stamps, with a side corridor leading to freight elevators down into the cargo decks. Off to starboard, a lit archway marked with flickering holo-signs ("SPACERS' WALK", "BERTH BAR", "CREW NEEDED") opens into a busier concourse of bars, gear shops, and hiring boards: exactly the kind of place you can disappear into a crowd, buy parts, or start quietly recruiting anyone reckless enough to sign on.

OOC: The airlock = The ship airlock



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Hopefully. Here's to a little more luck."

Asha Morrow:"Let's hit it." Asha gets up and heads to the airlock. tapping on her screen to search for an available contact that could hook her up with some buyers.

OOC: using the Contact ability to try and see if I know anyone here, gonna roll intuition, 1+ success means I know someone with a good relationship



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows a step behind, keeping a constant watch of their surrooundings_

Asha Morrow:

|(4+0) Intuition  <br>(0) Bonus Dice  <br>(0) Edge|



Narrator:OOC: Thank you for rolling

Asha's contact list comes up with something potentially useful.

**Maris "Ledger" Konn**, a gray‑market quartermaster who keeps an "overstock" warehouse off the Operations Tier (officially a surplus depot, unofficially where unlogged small arms and spell‑gear get laundered through fake teardown manifests)

Asha Morrow:She looks pleased, "I have a good lead, let's go." Asha pings Ledger and heads his way.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith follows* "Here's to a good lead."



Narrator:Asha leads the way to the Operations Tier. Maris "Ledger” Konn operates out of Bay 23, a supposedly "closed for refit” cargo spur just off the Operations Tier, down a service corridor marked MAINTENANCE ACCESS – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. At the end of that dim hallway, past humming conduits and forgotten tool lockers, there's a heavy roll‑up door with its official ID stenciled over in flaking paint and a small side hatch with a thumb‑reader; a discrete green holo-tag above it reads M. KONN – SURPLUS CONSULTING for those who know to look. The hatch is locked, waiting for someone to try the reader.

Asha Morrow:Asha tries the reader.



Narrator:The thumb-reader blinks, accepts Asha’s print with a soft chime, and the side hatch unlatches with a heavy clunk, swinging into a narrow antechamber that smells of metal dust and ozone and machine oil... Beyond, Bay 23 opens into a low‑ceiling warehouse lit by harsh strip lights. Aisles of mismatched crates, stripped spell‑rifle racks, and pallet stacks of "agri‑tools" that are obviously refitted weapon parts, with a caged back room where more serious hardware glints behind mesh. At a cluttered central desk surrounded by holo‑ledgers and weighing scales, Maris Konn looks up from a flickering manifest, eyes flicking from Asha to Kaelith, and offers a dry half‑smile that says she’d already checked their transponder ten minutes ago.

Maris doesn’t stand, just leans back in her chair and lets her gaze slide over Asha first.

"Well, look who drifted back in without a tow chain on her neck," she says, then flicks a colder, appraising look at Kaelith. "You didn’t mention you were bringing Confed tree‑royalty into my bay, Captain. Hope your Shayan friend remembers this is New Texas air he’s breathing, not some blessed canopy."

Asha Morrow:Asha walks in grinning and rolls her eyes, "Oh he's alright." she finds a place to sit, "Besides you'll love this conversation all the same." She looks across at Maris confidently.

Maris "Ledger" Konn:Maris snorts softly, fingers drumming a slow, irritated rhythm on a nearby crate as she looks between the two of them. “Last time someone opened with 'you'll love this conversation,' I lost three pallets and a docking sponsor," she says, but there's a sharp, interested glint in her eyes now. “So. What'd you bring me, Captain Morrow: clean surplus, hot war scrap, or trouble?"

Asha Morrow:Asha tilts her head side to side contemplating, "Hot war scrap and..maybe a touch of trouble. The best kind I promise."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:She taps the desk with her index finger twice. "Let's see it then."

"All I hear is sweet talk all day long. Impress me."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith folds his arms, clearly agitated by this situation_

Maris "Ledger" Konn can't help but smirk slightly. Whether this is about Asha or Kaelith is unclear.

Asha Morrow:Asha flashes a knowing look towards Kaelith then back to Maris, enjoying the way this conversation is about to change. She pulls up her real cargo manifest on her screen and passes it over to Maris, showing their remaining supplies minus the stealth coating and what Kaelith and her already took for themselves.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith unfurls his arms begins to slowly swirl a small ball of void between and around his finger tips_

Maris "Ledger" Konn:This message has been hidden.

Asha Morrow:OOC stealth coating is not on the manifest I showed, we're keeping that

Maris "Ledger" Konn:OOC: Hold let me retcon

Maris's smirk dies as she scrolls, jaw tightening when she hits "blank dream dragon scales", then she exhales through her teeth and sets the pad down like it's ticking. "You didn't bring me hot scrap, you brought me a procurement scandal and three separate audit flags. This is the sort of thing that gets yards shuttered and captains disappeared if anyone links it back, and I'm the one who has to crack it into a thousand 'lost in transit' lots, bribe inspectors, and pretend the dragon scales are artisanal kitchenware." She drums the desk once more, calculating. "For a fast, silent, no‑paper bulk unload, minus the scales, which I won't touch except as favors, I can float you twelve million and eat the risk; if you want anything closer to what this is actually worth, you walk it piece‑by‑piece through ten different fences and pray no one with a badge starts adding up the manifests."

Maris's expression drops as Kaelith starts manifesting a ball of void. She stiffens, one arm going below the table where a weapon is obviously kept. "What is that, your fidget toy? This one is your mage right? Void, so he is how you got here?"



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): is contacts a skill that I missed or is it a captain trait?

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Class traait

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Any time a captain reaches a new port or world they

Maris "Ledger" Konn:This message has been hidden.

This message has been hidden.

This message has been hidden.

This message has been hidden.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): They can do that, yeah

Asha Morrow:Asha stares back, "Relax, he's just messing about. You're lowballing me risk or not, after all the bribes and effort you'd stand to gain a hefty profit. Besides, we both know you're up to that challenge."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"We are certainly not here to play games Ms. Konn. If you can't handle the load, perhaps you know someone that can. For a cut of course."

Asha Morrow:Asha grins.

Maris "Ledger" Konn:She looks about to retort at Asha before Kaelith's remark makes her burst out laughing.

"All right, that's on me. You two are walking in here way too hot for my taste, but the money's too good. So I have you for twelve million then?"

She leans forward, extremely eager to close this.

(To Wartok): She is lowballing you so deep it's insulting

Asha Morrow:Asha stands up and turns to Kaelith, "My bad on this one, she's usually cool." and begins to leave.

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"What? Hey- wait, where are you going?"

Maris "Ledger" Konn stands up.

Asha Morrow:"What do you mean? You don't want our stuff. Thanks anyways."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Alllll right, come now. You can't fault me for trying. Come back, let's negotiate."

"And let me explain myself."

Maris "Ledger" Konn holds her hands up in guilt.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"We don't have a lot of time here, lots of folks to talk to. Better explain quickly."

Asha Morrow:Asha giggles and nods, "What he said."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"If you took that offer then I was going the send this straight to the Confederacy and be clean of it. They usually offer a pitiful bounty but a pitiful bounty on this is low, low seven figures."

"Not because I'm trying to wrong you, but because if you were willing to let it go for that price then you two were already done."

"So clearly you're serious. Does nobody know you have this stuff?"

Maris "Ledger" Konn talks fast.

Asha Morrow:"Nope, not even Lone Star."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Would anyone be looking for it in the future?"

Maris "Ledger" Konn she slowly takes a seat again.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Yes. **You**. And us of course. I for one would love to keep it that way."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"I'm not telling a soul. This would get me killed."

"And you do not tell anyone you met me."

Maris "Ledger" Konn waits a tick to make sure she hasn't lost them yet.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"No worries there. I'm not in the habit of flapping my gums to anyone."

Asha Morrow:"Well you see why I came to you, you know how to handle this." Asha sits again, "Someone might come looking for it, but there'll be a considerable delay in them doing so and a long trail for them to follow so there's time."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Weeks or months?"

Asha Morrow:"Sounded like the minimum was a month before they'd want it, add time for them to figure out I'm not fulfilling their contract and then trying to find out what happened."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Good. You want my honest appraisal? This is somewhere between 1.5 and 2 billion in raw gear. It's too much money for me to try bullshitting you anymore, but I still have my own interests at stake. Thirty percent is going to be lost to bribes, sheer labor costs to move it slowly and discretely, and all of the paper trails we have to generate to cover it. Of the remaining volume, I am willing to split it even with you. I can promise you 600 million. More if we're lucky, but don't bet on it."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - what would the roll be to determine how truthful we think she is being? Or would an intuition roll give us a feel for if she is worried ab out offloading this stuff?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Negotiation IMO

OOC - DT 4 for this level of negotiation

OOC - DT 3 if you just want basic truth



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:OOC - I'll give it a shot

Asha Morrow:OOC I'll go for it too

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): You are out of your depth



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): yeah. He would have a better idea of her feelings and motives more so than the prices and difficulty of the sales



(To Asha Morrow): Maris makes sense, more or less. She's telling the truth about this plan. There are other plans like you could tsell it to someone direct and get a lot more money, but that takes time or connections. You could find someone willing to take a lower cut, but they might not appreciate risk as much. It's nuanced but she's honest,.



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Feelings and motives wise, I think it's fair to say he can gauge that she has shifted notably since this all started. She is leaning forward, engaged, not too excited, not talking too quickly and clearly thinking things through, but not directing that toward you two like before.

Asha Morrow:Asha takes awhile to contemplate the offer, glancing over at Kaelith for a moment, then turns and smiles "I don't suppose you'd take a 60-40 split in my favor on the remainder after expenses because I'm you're new favorite captain."



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): How you interpret that is up to you though

Maris "Ledger" Konn:She smirks and it grows over a few moments as she gauges Asha.

"Too good to pass up. I'll take 40, final offer."

Asha Morrow:Asha holds out her hand, "Done"

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"You need anything else?"

"With what we're dealing, you can have uh... anything in the warehouse."

"Or contacts.":



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): can a true mage use a spell weapon to increase potency and damage?

Asha Morrow:Asha grins with a devious sparkle in her eye, "I need mercs actually. You know some relic hunters or other daredevils eager on catalysts?"

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): The benefit of spell weaponry is it doesn't expend pool. True Mage is more likely to have enough pool to push nicer weapons. A weapon with a limit of 5 for example would be hard to push for someone with only a pool of 3.

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Though to be honest with you I'm still struggling to fully conceptualize how Pool is "spent"? So at least for this session I'm just assuming your pool is your action pool for EACH round. So if you have 5 pool you can do 5 pool worth of spell actions that round. That can be two spells, with similar logic to how multi attacks work.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"What do you have in the way of fancy Spell weapons? I have wanted to play around with one for some time now."

(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): nevermind pool is regenerated after restful sleep, so yeah spell weaponry means you get to not waste your pool



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): and it is 3 times will plus archetype and other modifiers

(To Wartok): Aye right, it's sizeable



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): but enhancing bolts can use a good amount of pool, so it evens out a bit

Maris "Ledger" Konn:Maris leans back, thinking, then taps a few notes into her slate. “Best I can do on short notice is Rho Anselm, ex‑Confed captain, runs a contract outfit called Black Trace; he can put twenty disciplined guns on your deck tomorrow, but he’ll want danger pay and a clean ops brief. His core team's worth the trouble: Mudcat, a dirt‑born New Texas grease wizard who can keep your ship and spell armor running on duct tape and spite, Lysa, a true mage with a Catalyst problem and the wards to match, and Mr. Vale. He's a quiet type. Recon sniper I think from the war?" she says smiling.

"As for spell weapons, dear? I have some spell blades left over, but all the guns were taken in the last deployment. They undocked last night and are getting ready to head to the front, so yeah."

She squints. "You a war mage?"

Asha Morrow:Asha leans back in response mulling over the information, "What could I expect in terms of danger pay?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Fraid not dear. I was born into a family of mages on Shaya. You can take a guess from there."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Danger pay for what?"

"if you are able to divulge any details."

Maris "Ledger" Konn she half shrugs to Kaelith. "A family of mages on Shaya? Like saying you were born to a family of dock workers on Ternus."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Ain't you all mages there?"

Asha Morrow:"We've a good lead on a catalyst. Figured we'd check it out after making a deal"

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Ya don't say, Asha. You lead with that and promise to let them keep anything they haul back, probably no cost. Throw in a hundred thousand credits for supplies."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Most Shayan are mages indeed. I however am a mage of true blood. Gifted and birth."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"I still have your account on record. I'll credit you the twelve million now as a joke and a show of good faith so you can get it done."

She quickly taps it into a data pad in front of her and then eyes Kaelith. "What's that mean?"

"True blood. Magic is in your blood?"

Asha Morrow:Asha is all smiles, "I fucking love good business." she turns to Kaelith, "I'm learning so much about you! I should listen more."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"You start our meeting with racist remarks regarding my heritage and you don't even know about it. About mages in general for that matter?" _Will continuing to twirl the void ball in his left hand, he ignites his right hand with fire_



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): You're very good at this setting btw. I don't think you've said a single thing not perfectly aligned to the lore so don't hesitate



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): thanks



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Accidentally hit enter, don't hesitate to do whatever you like lore wise*



(To Wartok): You're welcome :)



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Woops, d/c'd

Maris "Ledger" Konn:Maris points her data pad with a limp-wrist at Kaelith, turning her head slightly in mild disgust. "You should be old enough to remember the war against Nebiat. When your guardian, Voria, destroyed Colony 3. Some of us had family there. Just because we're on the same side doesn't mean we haven't forgotten how many times Shaya stood by and watched our people die. Mayrid is _still_ recovering. I said to you to remember this is _our_ air you breathe. To remember where you stand. Anything is racist to you people, even having a little respect."



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Re-writing posts is always 10x harder for some reason

Asha Morrow:Asha opens her mouth as if to say something but thinks better of it and stays silent instead.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"And insinuating that I am foolhardy enough to not know where I am is respectful? Perhaps we should leave this conversation for another time and enjoy the fact that we all are filling our pockets with this deal."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Fair play. Let's keep it to business. You want me to send Rho to you or do you want to go vet him in person?"

Asha Morrow:Asha looks between the two of them one last time before responding, "I guess we'll go meet in person, I don't wanna head back to the ship yet anyways I want some barbecue."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:She sends the contact details to Asha's phone.

Asha Morrow:Asha stands up, "You need anything from me before we head out?"

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"All good here."

"I have a lot of work now. I'll get at it."

She sighs, taking a seat.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I'd be interested in meeting this Lysa also. And Mudcat could be useful." _Kaelith looks to Asha for her opinion_

Asha Morrow:Asha laughs, "Getting rich is hard work huh?" she turns to Kaelith, "I'd love to meet them, they sound great at what they do. Let's head over."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Agreed." _Kaelith looks at Maris_ "Well met Ms. Konn. I hope we can conduct further business in the future."

Maris "Ledger" Konn:"Yeah? I'd like that. Don't die."

"Now get the fuck out of my warehouse."

Asha Morrow:Asha gives a wave on her way out, "See you next time I have a life changing deal Ledger."

Maris "Ledger" Konn waves, not looking up.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows Asha out_

Asha Morrow:Asha walks and talks as they head towards wherever Maris sent them, "What was up with that back there? I totally missed whatever she said that bothered you so."



Narrator:Asha sends a brief greeting to the contact from Maris. They simply respond with coordinates in station. The internal map shows it's a local bar and food joint off the way from the usual paths.

It'll be a couple minutes walk and a couple elevators.

Asha Morrow:Asha seems pleased at the prospect of food.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith smiles_ "She made a couple of statements regarding Shayans that most of my people would have found insulting. I merely used that perceived insult as a reason to take a tough tone with her."

Asha Morrow:Asha chuckles and shakes her head, "_After_ we already made the deal?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I tend to remember people and like to leave them something to remember me. In the future, I would hope she doesn't try to bullshit us and gets down to business."

Asha Morrow:"Well on that we can agree, her initial offer was _pathetic_ I thought she was trying to turn us away or playing dumb. Figured she knew me better than to try that shit but can't blame her too bad its a big deal we made."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"It was a huge deal as long as she doesn't bullshit us on what she gets. If she does then we may be forced to take the rest out of her flesh."

Asha Morrow:She looks at him, surprised "Its not gonna go that way, she's incentivized to do right by us. A single anonymous tip fucks the whole operation."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Look, I barely know you and until 30 minutes ago, never heard of her. I believe that I can trust your instincts and decisions, but her i have nothing to judge by. I will take your word that she is incentivized and we shall see the outcome. I don't trust easily. I hope you can understand that."



Sshado C. (GM):The bar sits in a recessed corner off a quieter spur of the station. It is a wide, low room of stained metal and dark wood paneling that someone dragged up from planet-side, its air thick with smoke, sizzling fat, and the bite of good whiskey. A long bar runs one side, taps and bottles under a flickering neon steer skull, but tonight nearly every stool and table is owned by Black Trace: clusters of ex‑soldiers in mixed civvies and worn combat gear, laughing too loud over trays of brisket, ribs, and overflowing beer pitchers, their rifles and armor stacked in casual, practiced piles within arm's reach. At the back, under a hanging holo of a rust‑red New Texas sunset, a long table has been half‑cleared; Rho Anselm sits there with Mudcat, Lysa, and Tamsin, a few empty chairs left like deliberate bait, and when Asha and Kaelith step through the door Rho catches sight of them, lifts a dripping rib in salute, and waves them over with a captain's easy assumption they'll come.

Asha Morrow:"I understand. We've been thrust into a partnership very quickly, but this is about my money too; I wouldn't make a deal with someone I didn't think would pay me." Asha grins as they come up on the bar and heads over to Rho's table immediately, "Howdy."

She takes a seat and will grab a plate of food if available.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith follows into the bar and over to Rho's table. He glances over the group crowding the bar and takes stock of what he sees_



Narrator:Rho sits at the head of the table in a faded captain's jacket, half‑turned so he can watch the whole bar, calmly carving strips off a slab of brisket while he needles Mudcat about "losing another engine to duct tape religion," which earns him a grease‑stained middle finger and a slurred defense about "field‑tested solutions" between mouthfuls of ribs. Lysa has a glass of something high‑octane and ugly in one hand, her other hand idly tracing tiny drifting ember‑motes over the tabletop as she and Tamsin argue in low voices about whether Primals dream. Lysa insists they do, Tamsin dryly betting a week's pay that "if they do, they dream about getting shot in the head." When Rho spots Asha and Kaelith, he finishes whatever joke he was telling ("…and that's when the Titan decided the cruiser was a toothpick"), lets the laughter roll a beat, then lifts his glass and calls, "Morrow! Bring your Shayan and sit; nobody leaves this table hungry or uninformed."

Rho Anselm is a broad‑shouldered man in his late 40s with close‑cropped iron‑and‑black hair, a well‑kept beard, and a faded Confed captain’s jacket that still sits on him like a uniform.

"Mudcat" is lanky and bow‑legged, with sun‑leathered skin, oil‑blackened fingernails, a permanent squint, and a sweat‑stained ball cap shoved back over unruly brown hair.

Lysa is pale and sharp‑featured, with hollowed cheeks, short uneven dark hair, faint burn‑freckle scars at her temples, and eyes that catch light like embers when she smiles.

Tamsin is tall and wiry, with close‑shaved sandy hair, a long scar running from jaw to collarbone, and the habit of moving with quiet, precise economy even when she’s supposedly off‑duty.

This message has been hidden.

Rho Anselm:Rho wipes his hand on a napkin, offers it across the table to Asha first, then to Kaelith. "Captain Morrow, I presume, and the mage Maris warned me might set my bar on fire," he says with a dry half‑smile. "Rho Anselm, Black Trace; eat first, then tell me what kind of trouble pays well enough you’re buying twenty guns and my best people to go poke at Primals."

Lysa Vorren:She immediately stops talking about primals and turns partway to observe the newcomers.

Asha Morrow:Asha leans across to shake Rho's hand and then sets herself a plate with a couple ribs and some brisket, "A catalyst" Asha responds quickly as she bites into a rib

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Leans back into her chair and stares at the ceiling, hands tucked behind her head.

Rho Anselm gives Asha a firm but not uncomfortable shake.

Rho Anselm:"And how many of my crew are allowed to touch the Catalyst if we make it through?"

Asha Morrow:OOC - is there a limit on the number of people who can receive a benefit from touching a catalyst?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - No, generally the lowest tier catalyst can support a million mages. Your map would've shown you this is a 25.

OOC - ANd it's not linear. It's exponential.

OOC - Lowest as a 1



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith reaches for Rho's hand after Asha has finished_

Asha Morrow:Asha turns to Kaelith like she hadn't thought of this question then back to Rho, "Uh, anyone who survives? Why would I care?"

Rho Anselm:He shrugs. "Generous but fair. And how about salvage? Materials we find there? Weapons?"

Lysa Vorren:Her eyes light up at Asha's reply.

Lysa Vorren turns sharply to look at Rho but stops before saying anything.

Rho Anselm gives Kaelith a firm shake, meeting his gaze with a warm smile.

Rho Anselm:"Friend, it's good to meet a Shayan out here."

Asha Morrow:"We'll cover basic supplies and anything reasonable you suggest bringing for your crew. You keep anything you can carry back, I don't care man."

Asha is diving into the ribs at this point, her face is covered in sauce.

Lysa Vorren:"Can you tell me more about this Catalyst?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"The pleasure is mine. A man who can keep a rowdy bunch like this in line is worth knowing."

Rho Anselm grins knowingly.

Rho Anselm:"Ain't easy."

"Asha, we'll work well together."

Asha Morrow:OOC - is the Catalyst rating (1 being the lowest, 25 being the catalyst we're heading to) a known thing among people who do this kind of work?



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - You'd roughly know that it's a shard of a titan or some kind of extremely major God. Maybe not the specifics. That kind of information is dangerous. It's important to know ahead of time, but also something to not trust people with.

OOC - Whatever this thing is, it's borderline galaxy ending levels of power.

OOC - Now, that kind of power isn't just given automatically. That's just how much is there.

Asha Morrow:Asha stops eating for a moment and leans towards Lysa to answer, "I know its supposed to be a big deal, not a small one. Was told its Dream."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Lysa is it?" _Kaelith says turning his gaze her direction_ "Your interest is obvious my dear. What may I ask intrigues you so much about Catalysts?"

Lysa Vorren:"Oh? Fascinating. I don't know of a single Dream catalyst in this sector. I always hoped to find one. I'm not surprised it's a big deal."

Lysa tips her head, studying him over the rim of her glass, ember‑motes curling lazily around her fingers. "Magic's my native tongue, and Catalysts are the only places it speaks in full sentences," she says with a smile. "You walk inside one of those and, for a little while, the universe stops mumbling at you and starts telling you what it really is, assuming it doesn't eat you first."

She cuts out playing with her magic and focuses on the conversation.

Asha Morrow:Asha takes a beat to properly dive into the rest of her barbecue and finish it before she needs to respond again.

Judd "Mudcat" Harrow:Mudcat is currently wrist-deep in ribs, staring at the conversation unfold with a drunken chuckle. "Here we go," he says.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith smiles at her_ "It is good to meet someone else who can appreciate the song sung by the Catalysts. The Operas they can perform is truly magnificent."

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Tamsin stands up and slides a pack of cigarettes out of her jacket. She slinks out to the front of the bar to light up.

Asha Morrow:Asha quickly cleans herself up a bit and stands up to follow Tamsin, "Could I bum a cigarette?"

Lysa Vorren:Lysa's mouth quirks, equal parts amusement and recognition. "Operas, huh? Most crews I’ve run with just call it 'the screaming,'" she says, tipping a glass of smooth golden liquor back for a sip. "But if you can hear music in it, Shayan, that's exactly the kind of crazy I want standing next to me when the curtain goes up."

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:Tamsin flicks her wrist, producing the pack with a cigarette sticking neatly out without looking.

"Sure, need a light?"

Asha Morrow:"Please" she leans in



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith emulates the embers that Lysa had been toying with except he creates a version using flames of black and purple_

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale leans in lights up Asha's cigarette. She straightens up and lowers hers to the side after taking a drag.

Asha Morrow:Asha takes a long first hit and closes her eyes as she exhales, enjoying the initial buzz.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:“Been on a Catalyst run before?” she asks after a beat, eyes on the station lights instead of Asha.

Asha Morrow:"Never had the opportunity, sounds like yall been on plenty though. How many?"



Narrator:Around them the bar thrums like a half‑tuned engine: Black Trace mercs slam shot glasses in unison, shout over some filthy war story, and break into bursts of raucous laughter that rattle the wall‑mounted holo of a New Texas sunset. Someone at a nearby table starts a slurred betting pool on "who pukes first when we hit hard burn," punctuated by the clatter of cred‑chips and the thunk of a knife being idly sunk into the tabletop between fingers. At the bar, a pair of ex‑soldiers argue loud and joking over which shipyard BBQ joint is "real" while an overworked bartender weaves through the chaos with fresh pitchers, dodging swinging arms and the occasional off‑key chorus of an old Confed marching song.

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"Three." She watches the smoke curl, jaw working once.

"Walked away from two of them. Third one…we’ll call that a tactical retreat."

She pauses for a beat then adds, a hint of of a laugh somewhere behind it. "You chose an interesting way to get killed at least."

Asha Morrow:Asha chuckles as she exhales smoke, "That's exactly what I figured, hard to find a better story for my death huh."

Lysa Vorren:Her brows lift, the corner of her mouth curling as the colors shift. "Void in your fire, hm? So you follow the path of Destruction?" She leans in just a little, studying the black‑purple flames. "Careful with that blend, Shayan. Dream loves a pretty imbalance to pull on."

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"Stories are for the ones who make it back," she says, mouth twitching around the cigarette.

"If you’re smart, you aim for 'old and boring' and let everyone else turn you into legend."

Asha Morrow:"Well..maybe I'm not _that_ smart." she seems pleased with herself, "Some opportunities are too good to let pass on by."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"Dream my dear is the key to the universe. Dream mixed with fire the map to all untold secrets. Imbalance is just someone's view of something unknown. I am very confident in the direction I walk, and gathering dream will show me the best routes to get there."

Lysa Vorren:Lysa leans in over the table, the collar of her dark, close‑fitted coat falling open just enough to show a thin lattice of old burn‑freckles at her throat, arcane sigils stitched in faint ember‑thread along the sleeves that glimmer when the light catches them. Her eyes stay fixed on the black‑violet flames dancing over Kaelith's fingers, curiosity and professional hunger mingling there like a mage studying a rare specimen, the hint of a smile ghosting her lips as if she’s already imagining what kind of trouble the two of them could make together.

"That’s the kind of talk that gets carved into memorial plaques," she says softly, amusement and something sharper in her eyes. "But I won’t argue. Dream shows the paths; Fire decides which ones you’re willing to burn to reach. Just don’t be surprised when the universe starts staring back while you’re busy mapping it."

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:"Smart's overrated out here," she says, watching the smoke drift toward the ceiling vents.

"Most of the rich ones I’ve met just got lucky and didn’t flinch. Sounds like you’re at least halfway qualified."

She glances sideways at Asha. "You don't seem like the type to flinch anyway."

Asha Morrow:Asha finishes her cigarette and finds somewhere to ash it, turning to look back at Tamisn, "You've good eyes. Frankly, I'll take halfway qualified."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith’s next thought rises unbidden—quiet, razor-edged, and warm as the black-violet fire coiling around his knuckles:

Of course it will stare back. Let it. I’ve spent a lifetime being watched by those who feared what I might become. The universe is just another witness—one I finally intend to impress.

His gaze holds on Lysa a heartbeat longer than necessary, catching the ember-thread sigils glowing along her coat, the constellation of old burn-marks at her throat. She understands more than most, he realizes, a flicker of intrigue threading through him. Fire hasn’t scared her. Dream hasn’t confused her. And Void… perhaps she’s the first who wouldn’t flinch at the truth of it.

Another curl of flame spirals up his thumb as the thought tightens, settles, sharpens:

If the universe stares back—good. I’ll stare harder

Tamsin "Longstep" Vale:She studies Asha for a second, then gives a small, almost imperceptible nod. “Just remember, when it goes bad, you keep moving your feet and I'll keep their heads down; that’s how halfway qualifies for 'alive.'"

Tamsin puts out her cigarette and tosses it in a nearby ashtray. She heads back inside to sit.

Asha Morrow:Asha follows and takes her seat, tempted by more food but decides not to. She looks around the table, taking the temperature.

Lysa Vorren:For a moment she simply watches him watch the flames, feeling that intent press out from behind his eyes like heat from a door left ajar. She doesn't sense fear there, and she wouldn't call it bravado, but someone who’s already decided the universe is an audience. It tugs at something old and hungry in her, memories of standing in Catalyst shadows with lesser mages who never listened for answers.

Aloud, she lets the corner of her mouth curl. "Good," she says. "So tell me, Kaelith, when you finally get inside a Dream Catalyst, what is it you’re actually hoping it shows you? Why this one? Is it just the power?"

Rho Anselm:Rho gives Asha a nod as she returns.

Asha Morrow:Asha returns the nod, otherwise listening quietly to the ongoing conversation.

Judd "Mudcat" Harrow:Mudcat Harrow is sprawled sideways on his chair like he’s half in a bunk, boots hooked on the rung, coveralls stained every shade of oil and coolant, a grimy cap shading eyes that are sharper than his lazy drawl suggests. He’s got a rib in one hand and a battered multitool in the other, idly taking apart and reassembling a broken tap handle while he heckles a younger merc about "city boys who don’t know a plasma injector from a piss funnel," laughter coming easy but his gaze flicking now and then to Asha and Kaelith to size up the people who just signed his next paycheck.

Rho Anselm:"Crew likes you well enough and they like the odds even better," he says, glancing down the table at Lysa and Tamsin before looking back to Asha.

He leans in a bit to talk to her easier.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith’s answer comes slowly—not from hesitation, but from weighing how much truth to let slip between the cracks.

“No,” he says at last, voice low but steady. “If it were just power, I wouldn’t have left Shaya. Power was the one thing they were willing to give me—so long as I wore it their way.”

He lifts his eyes to hers, and the ember brightens, reflecting in both sets of pupils like a tiny collapsing star.

“I want a Dream Catalyst because it doesn’t tell you what to be. It shows you what could be… every possibility you’ve never been allowed to imagine. And Void—” He breathes out a soft, dark laugh. “Void is hungry for possibility. It thrives in the spaces other mages refuse to look.”

His fingers close around the ember, extinguishing it, though faint veins of amethyst light pulse once beneath his skin.

“So what am I hoping to see?” He leans in slightly, matching her earlier posture, the edge of a grin forming—not arrogant, but fiercely certain.



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:“Not destiny. Not prophecy. Not some Shayan elder’s version of enlightenment. I want the Catalyst to show me the one thing no one’s ever been brave enough to put into a vision.”

A beat. A breath. A truth sharpened to a point.

“Myself. Unrestricted. Unfiltered. Without the chains of what I was supposed to be.”

He tilts his head, studying her the way she studied him moments earlier.

“And why this Catalyst? Because it’s the first one that feels like it won’t be afraid of the answers.”

Asha Morrow:Asha leans toward him in return, "Well good, I trust yall's experience with this and I feel confident Kaelith and I are prepared for when things get fucked up."

Lysa Vorren:She leans back, turning her chin up slightly. "What makes you think this Catalyst is the one? Do you know which God it once was?"

Rho Anselm:"Cheers then. When do we leave?"

Asha Morrow:"Soon, I just need enough time to get affairs in order and gather whatever supplies ya think your team needs beyond whatever you're already bringing yourselves." Asha flicks out her phone and pings Ledger for a rough estimate on time to unload their cargo.

Rho Anselm:"We got supplies and a ship. Unless we're riding with you?"

Maris "Ledger" Konn:Ledger pings back 8 hours.

Asha Morrow:Asha raises her eyebrows, intrigued "What's your ship like?"



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:Kaelith’s smile returns—but this time it’s narrower, edged with that quiet, unsettling confidence Lysa has already begun to recognize as uniquely his.

“The thing about Gods,” he says, rolling one shoulder in a subtle shrug, “is that everyone assumes you have to know which one you’re dealing with to understand its purpose.”

A thin ribbon of void-flame coils between his fingers—silent, weightless, as if reacting to the thought rather than the gesture.

“But a dead God—” his eyes flick to hers, bright and sharp, “—isn’t a God anymore. It’s a resonance. A shape left behind in the world. A wound or a whisper. And wounds tell you more truth than shrines ever do.”

He taps the table lightly with two fingers, as though marking a point in an argument only he can see.

“I don’t need a name to recognize a presence. This Catalyst feels like… pressure against the edges of possibility. Like something that didn’t die, it collapsed under its own potential. That’s Void’s language, Lysa. That’s its script.”



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:He leans forward again, voice lower, more intimate—not flirtation, but revelation.

“Which God was it? Maybe I’ll learn that. Maybe I won’t. But that isn’t why I’m drawn to it.”

A beat. A small, knowing half-smile.

“I think this Catalyst is the one because it doesn’t care who approaches it—only whether they can survive being seen by what’s left of it.”

He narrows his gaze slightly, amusement flickering in the violet light playing across his features.

“And I’ve spent my whole life surviving the gaze of things that were supposed to define me.”

Lysa Vorren:"I see," she says quietly. Lysa picks up her drink and finishes it off while shooting Rho a quick glance. He doesn't perceptibly react, but she leans back in her seat.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): I hope you don't mind, but i am using Ai to help develop Kaelith's personality



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Use any tools you like!



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:_Kaelith extinguishes the remaining void flames and leans back into his seat as well, flashing one final devious grin at Lysa_



(To Kaelith Voryn-Shai): Some time I should show you how to hook yours up to my game repository. It's real easy and would give you better results.



(From Kaelith Voryn-Shai): that would be sweet

Lysa Vorren:She can't help but smirk.

"Asha, what kind of ship are you bringing? Can it support two mages?"

Asha Morrow:OOC do you remember what all we had installed onto my ship? I know we had spell weaponry added I just dont know if that'd be a one person job or not



Sshado C. (GM):OOC - Spell drive and spell cannon, one matrix

OOC - Just one mage

OOC - Need bigger ship for more mages

Asha Morrow:Asha turns away from waiting for Rho and answers, "Naw, just one."

Lysa Vorren:"Ah, that's a shame. Was hoping you were some kind of rich gal with a destroyer."

"No matter. We don't need it."

Lysa Vorren waves the idea off.

Lysa Vorren:"Hopefully we only see primals on the surface. If there's a guardian then our odds drop drastically."

"In fact I would say we just leave if we see one."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"I can vouch for that opinion Asha. A guardian may be more than we want to try and chew on right now."

Asha Morrow:For the briefest moment Asha considers waiting for some of the credits to roll in from the deal to buy a destroyer for this job but she shakes it away, "I'll take your recommendation on that. If the ones with experience want to leave if the situation develops like that, fair enough."

Rho Anselm:"Could do the old bait and switch."

"One ship distract the Guardian, the other land, get to the Catalyst, get out."

Asha Morrow:"Again, I'd defer to your experience on dealing with them, but the trade-off there is that less people get to touch it. Better than none, but still important to think about."

Judd "Mudcat" Harrow:"Bait and switch sounds real noble until you’re the bait," he drawls around a toothpick, tipping his chair back.

Asha Morrow:"Exactly my thought."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai:"That's a bold option Rho." _Kaelith smirks_ "I like the way you think."

Rho Anselm thumbs up to Kaelith.

Rho Anselm:"Well then, get in touch when you're ready to leave. We're always ready, assuming there's a few hours umbral transit to sober up."

Lysa Vorren:Lysa’s gone quiet, listening more than talking: one elbow on the table, glass cradled in her hand, eyes half‑lidded as if she’s replaying old Catalyst runs in her head while the others spitball tactics.

Asha Morrow:Asha stands up, "Understood, should be ready within 12 hours if ya need a timeframe."

Rho Anselm:"Easy then, plenty of time for R&R and sleep."



Kaelith Voryn-Shai stands and nods before turning to exit the bar

Asha Morrow:Asha gives a wave and heads out as well to make arrangements.



Sshado C. (GM):OOC: Suppose we have to call it here then. Nice session :)

Asha Morrow:OOC thanks for the session yall was fun
